should not be supplied. — The
first half of this line is quoted by a
speaker in the dialogue of Cicero's
de Oratore, II. 39, to excuse an
interruption. — πάλιν, encore.

706 ff. There is no refenence,
direct or indirect, in Latin litera-
ture which warrants the supposi-
tion that there were contests on
the Roman stage between different
poets. Plautus must, therefore,
have taken 706 directly from the
Greek original, without regard for
the fact that the allusion would be
,unintelligible to the audience and
perhaps without understand-ing it
himself. The text of 708 is con-
fused, turis being unintelligible,
but the meaning of the two lines is,
‘ He acts more ‘m harmony with the

plot and keeps better time. For
your folly Ι will fine you a mina.'—
uersus ε cf. Stich. 770, si istm me
uorsu uice-ris . . . The sudden
change from a compar-ison of plays
to a comparison of actors‚ the
confusion of persons (hic, 706, is
Lesbonicus ς hie, 707, is Lysiteles3
tua, 706, Lysiteles3 te, 708, Les-
bonicus), and the reference to the
infliction of fines upon actors all
show that these vsa are a late in-
terpolation.

709 f. See Introd. 13 b. In all
these questions quid tibi means
what right have you to . . . ‚⁹ or
what do you mean by . . ,Ρ It
could not mean how, quomodo, but
Stasimus twists it into that sense
by retorting eodem modo, i.e.,
pedibus. The leading verb in the
reply would properly be accessi3
the effect of interchanging the
verbs is to make the sentence mean,
‘You may learn how I got in by
seeing how I now get out! With
these words he retreats quickly into
the background from which he had
come forward to speak‚ 705.
