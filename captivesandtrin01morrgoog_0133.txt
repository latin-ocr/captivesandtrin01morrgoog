TRINVMMVS 91

Nunc {gitur primum quae ego sim et quae illaec siet
Huc quae abiit intro dicam, si animum aduortitiS.
Primum mihi Plautus nornen Luxuriae indidit:

Tum Ι hanc mihi gnatam esse uoluit 1nopiam.

Sed ea huc quid introierit inpulsu me0, 10
Accipite et date uociuas auris dum eloquor.
Adulescens quidamst qui in hisce habitat aedibus:

Is rem paternam me adiutrice perdidit.

Quoniam ei qui me aleret nss uideo esse relicui,

Dedi e1' meam gnatam quicum aetatem exigat. Ῑ5
Sed de argumento ne exspectetis fabulae:

Senes qui huc uenient ι’ rem uobis aperient.

Huic Graece nornen est Thensauro fabulae:

8. Luxuriae: with nomen esse,
facere, indere, Plautus regularly
puts the proper name in the dative
(Capt. 69; 726; 9843 Trin. 391,
and below 18 and 20). The few
exceptions are nearly all in pro-
logues.

10. quid: with verb of motion,
Introd. 16 a.

ιι. uociuas = uacuas. The
form is supported here by the
Milan palimpsest andin other pas-
sages by MSS. and by the meter.
Plautus does not use uacuus. For
uacuae aures, cf. Lucr. Ι. 5ο, Hor.
Ep. Ι. 16. 26, Quint. X. 1. 32.

1 2. Monosyllabic hiatus, Introd.
48 c. ——hiscet dat. and abl.‚ hosce,
hasce, are used by Plautus before
vowels, the shorter forms before
consonants; horu‘nc, haru'nc are
used before consonants, hdrunc,
hdrunc before vowels. The other
forms in -ce, huiusce, huic-e, etc„
are not used by Plautus,

1 4 f. quoniam: in temporal sense
(=qu0m—iam),as in 1 12, 149, and a
few other places in Pl. The causal
force, however, is more common

and is invariable in Ten—qui:
not nom„ but the old abl. (suffi-
ciently described in Harper's Lexi-
con) referring to nil. -The tenseS,
historical pres„ impf. subjunc.,
perf„ preS. subjunc., do not con·
form to mechanical laws of tense
sequence, but express with entire
naturalness the speaker’ s varying
point of view. —relicui: for the
gen., see Introd. 14 c; relicuos al-
ways has four syllables· m Pl. and
down to Persius. The word was
avoided by the Augustan poetS.
Cf. gr atus Capt. 106 n. and laruae,
Capt. 598 n.

17. i or ei, is or eis (dat. and
abl.) are the Plautine formS, not
it, isses —rem. . ‚aperient. the
explanations necessary to enable
the spectator to follow the play
intelligently are frequently given
in the prologue. Plays like the
Amph. or the Capt. require such
explanation; the Trin. does not.

18. Thensauro: the Latinized
form of θησαυρός is Thensaurus in
the best MSS. wherever the word
occurs in Pl.
