100 PLAVTI [1. 2. 82.

Ei rei operam dare te fuerat aliquanto aei-quiue,

Siqus probiorem facere posseS, non uti

In eandem tute accederes infamiam

Malumque ut eius curn tuorrnisceres male.

CA. Quid feci? ΜΕ. Quod homo nequam. CA. Non
istuc meumst. ’

ΜΕ. Emistin de adulescente has aedes — quid taces ?—

Vbi minc tute habitas? CA. Emi atque argentum

120

dedi,

1²5

Minas quadraginta, adulescenti ipsi in manum.
ΜΕ. Dedistin argentum? CA. Factum, neque facti

piget.

ΜΕ. Edepol fide adulescentem mandatum malae:
Dedistine hoc facto ei gladium qui se occideret. ’

Quid secus est aut quid interest dare te in manus

119. ei rei refers to the thought
of 118, but it is also explained by
siqui (old abl.) . . . posses, which
is connected with it as a kind of
indirect question, to see whether.

120. non uti . . . ut ε the exact
phrase would be quam accedere
. . . miscere, but the second part
of the comparison is changed,
with colloquial freedom3 the ad·
versative non is substituted for
quam and the ut-clauses for the
infin.

123. meumst, my way ,· cf. 445

will be conscious of guilt, and
therefore demands an answer by
quid taces? and prevents any
quibble by pointing to the house
and adding ubi . . . habitas.
But Call. is so free from any
sense of wrong-doing that he tells
the whole story, even adding in

126 unnecessary details not called
for by the question.

127. dedIstin: Introd. 47. In
emotional repetitions Plautus
more frequently omits -ne, but
he also uses it in a number of

than this.

129. dedistine and 136 incon-
ciliastin are printed as they stand
in the Mss„ but are to be trans-
lated as exclamatory or declara-
tive sentences. 1 do not feel
clear that the exclamatory -ne was
used in such sentences as these,
but 1 am entirely convinced that
-ne could not have the sense of
nonne in either passage, and that,
if such a sense were possible with
perf. indic. 2d sing„ it would be
entirely out of place here.

130. The sense is, ‘ What is the
difference between giving him a
sword to kill himself and giving
him money to spend ? ’ There is
tautology in quid secus est and
