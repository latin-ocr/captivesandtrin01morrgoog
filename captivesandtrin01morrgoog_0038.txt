xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

scio ἕδεύῐᾱος in this way are explained quantities like uolilptlriue,
clamationes, uetilstate, iiluentute, see 41.

It should be noticed that these shortenings by the accent
or ictus are confined to iambic combinations‚ the second syl-
lable of which becomes short when it is immediately pre-
ceded or followed by the accent or ictus. That is, ύ -
becomes ύ υ and υ - g' becomes υ υ 92, but -L - never
becomes -'- υ nor does - - -'- become - υ -'-. The syl·
⁸ lable to be shortened must always follow a short syllable.

48. Hiatus is found in the verse of Plautus under certain
conditions for the most part clearly defined :

a) In the diaeresis or caesura of tetrameters‚ that is, of bacchic
and cretie tetrameters and of septenarii and octonarii, whether iambic,
trochaic, or anapestic. Syllaba anceps also occurs at the same place in
the verse, and this shows that the neglect of elision is not a hiatus in the
strict sense.

b) Hiatus is allowed in change of speakerS, though elision is more
frequent, and is excused in a few cases by a strongly marked pause in
the midst of a speech: Pseud. 31, 79, 448; Capt. 139, 15²3 Trin. 185 (ἓ),
432, etc.

c) A monosyllable having a long vowel or a short vowel followed by
m is usually not elided under the ictus before a word beginning with a
short vowel, but is shortened, as di ament, qui homO, quae eg0, nim
ego, tiim eras. This is called monosyllabic hiatuS, and is so frequent
that it was evidently not regarded as a hiatus. When the monosyllable
is not accented, however, hiatus* rs very rare.

d) Except under these conditions it is not probable that Plautus
regarded hiatus as justifiable. As the whole matter is one of euphony,
it ispossible that the sounds of the two vowels may sometimes have
rendered hiatus less harsh 3 proper nameS, which at times excuse cer·
tain licenses even in strict versification‚ may have excused hiatus;
there are some indications of hiatus in the caesura of iambic senarius.
But no sufficient proof has yet been given of any of these positions, and

it is quite certain that the large majority of cases of hiatus in the MSS.
are due to errors of copyistS.
