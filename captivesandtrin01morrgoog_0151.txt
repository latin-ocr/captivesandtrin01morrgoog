Quod ecbibit, quod comest, quod facit sumpti.

242. qui amat: not exactly
equal to amator, which denotes a
fixed relation, gallant, nor is quod
amat exactly amica. The latter
is often used and cf. the two to-
gether in Merc. 744, qui amat,
quod amat st habet, id habet pro
ctbo. —eius is to be supplied with
sauiis as the antecedent of
quod.

243-2 5 5 describe the ruin of
the young man in cretic VSS. which
pass into trochaics at the crisis
(2 52—2 53) with short iambic lines to
bring the thought to a close. The
metrical group and the connected
set of thoughts correspond.

243. res labitur: ct'. Lucr. IV.
112 3, labitur interea res. — foras,
away, a not infrequent use. Cf.
foras dare, to publislt and Stich.
219, foras uendere. — labitur,
liquitur 2 cf. turbant, miscent, 285.
This asyndetic combination of
pairs of words is very common in
Pl. —liquitur makes this vs. acat-
alectic, while the following vss‚
are catalectie.

244. si audes„ {f you please.
The verb audeo is for auideo (aui-
dus, aueo) and its proper meaning
is to desire, misle, not to dare.
From this se‘nse it is weakened in
si audes to a mere phrase of cour-

teous urgency‚ and was so fre·

to sis, 650, and si uoltis to sultis,

Capt. 456 n.

245. cuculus:
used as a term of reproach, Pseud.
96, Asin. 923, 934, but the origin
of the usage is unknown.

247 ff. pendentem ferit refers
to the scourging of slaves while
they were suspended by the wristS,
an extreme kind of punishment.
The reference is explained by
iam amplius orat; she goes to
extremes in her demands. amplius
here 1s the adverb, as orare takes
only the neut. pron. as object of
the thing. —The indicatives ecbi-
bit, etc„ make it necessary to take
id as the antecedent of qu0d;
ni amplius etiam refers to the
further expenses complained of
below, 251 ff. This would make

living expenses, 247—2 503 and the
