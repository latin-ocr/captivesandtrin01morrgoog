see Introd. 48 b.

From this point to the end of
the scene the speakers are con-
fused· m the MSS„ and the words
are such that they mi g,ht with
slight changes, be given geither to
Erg. or to Hegio. 111118,152,
1111131 118 supposed to be explained
by a gesture, and the sense pwould
be, (Heg.) ‘ Keep up a good beart!
(Erg.) ιΑ1331 11 13 1101 my-beart
but my stomach (huic) that aches!
This is somewhat forced, but giv-
ing huie . . .
(so the MSS.) introduces still
more serious complications. On
the other objection‚ that the jokes
are not suited to the character of
HegiO, see Introd. 51.

153. remittere exereitum and
imperare exercitum. the techni-
cal terms for disbanding an army
and for assuming command. For
the metaphor, see Introd. 1 1.

160 Ε. The names of troops pun
upon names of articles of food and
names of towns= Pistorensibus

from pistor (miller, baker) and
Pais-toda in Etruria, Placentinis
from placenta and Placentia 011

and perhaps 3 Spanish tribe whose
name might have become known
through the military operations
during the Second Punic War-
The geographica] reference of
Paniceis (parus) and Ficedulen-

sibus (ficedula, a 3111311 bird) can
only be· guessed at. The 1331 vs..

of course, refers to fish.

164. milites opus sunt: the
predicate use of opus is probably
the original one (cf. Most. 412, id
uiri doctist opus). The instru-
mental abl. (1603 225; Most. 251)
13 111018 80111111011 and was perhaps
formed on the analogy of the abl.
with the verbal noun usus (Amph.
505; Βα. 706 f.; Trin. 503 f.).
Plautus has also after opus the
infin. (Pers. 584), 1118 388. and infin.
(Ba. 989), the subjunc. with ut
(Truc. 500) and without (Merc.
1004), and possibly the acc. (cf.
Truc. 902 ff. with Ps. 385).
