sense, and would be so under-
stood by the audience.

Excfl‘ffl SCENE. Callicles, who
left the stage at 614 to find Mega·
ronides and get his advice on the
new’ complications introduced by
the necessity of giving a dowry to
the young woman, returns in ear-
nest consultation with his friend.
The first line is intended to show
that he has informed Megaronides
of the situation.

729. ut narras: Introd. 33 a.

733 f. The connection of'

thought is this: (Meg.) ‘Certainly
the· dowry must be furnished at
once! (Call.) ‘Yes‚ it would be
discreditable to allow her to ·be
married without a dowry, when 1

have money in hand for that pur-
pose.’ (Meg.) ‘ Of course you have
the dowry all ready (but the trouble
is not at that point); don't you think
you had better wait until after the
marriage and arrange the matter
quietly with Philto ?’ The words
parata dos domist repeat quom

. . domi and concede that point.
—nisi, expressing an exception,
is here admost adversative. Ritschl
(and most editors) suppose that
vss. have been lost after 733.—
exspectare = usually followed by
dum in P1.‚ but used with ut in
Cic, Caes„ Livy, and later writers.

738. uerum. i.e.‚ ‘though I
suggest this as a possible plan, I
do not advise it, because.
