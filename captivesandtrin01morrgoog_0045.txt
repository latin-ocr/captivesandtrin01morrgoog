-The acrostic arguments were
written by a grammarian of the
time of the Antonine& ‘when the
early comedy was a subject of
grammatical study and comment,
or less probably at the period of
the first Plautine revival, 150—50
Rc, The limitations of the artifi-
cial form appear in the awkward-

ness of the language: alium for-

ant-rum, 2 and 93 amittatur for
amitteretur, 73 the omission of
the subject of amittatur and of
agnoscit, 93 and the obscurity of
is, 8. There is an attempt to imi-
tate the language of Pl.‚ capteiuei,

Ibus for eis, ipsus», amittere for
dimittere (as in prol. 36), quoiuS‚
perhaps fugitiuom and conmer-
catur, though the extent ofthis
imitation in the matter of spelling
can only be surmised. There are
39 cases of hiatus in 166 vss. of the
acrostic arguments, of which 21 are
in the main caesura„ in imitation
of a supposed usage in Pl. Introd.
48 d. Besides this there are many
corruptions in the MSS„ as in vs.
4, which is incomplete. It might
be filled out with gnatum captum
recuperet (Brugmann), or recu-
peret retro (Schoell), or with suom.
