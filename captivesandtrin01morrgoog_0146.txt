104 PLAVTI

[1. 2. 141.

Qui emisset, eius essetne ea pecunia?

Emi egomet potius aedis: argentum dedi

Thensauri causa, ut saluom amico traderem. 180
Neque adeo hasce erni mihi nec usurae meae:

1111 redemi russum, a me argentum dedi.

Haec sunt: si recte seu peruorse facta sunt,

Ego me fecisse confiteor, Megaronides,

Em mea malefacta, Ι em meam auaritiam tibi. Ῑ85
Hasce mihi propter res malas famas ferunt.

ME. Παῦσαιε uicisti castigatorem tuom.

Occlusti linguam: nss est quod respondeam.

CA. N unc ego te quaeso ut me opera et consilio iuues
Communicesque hanc mecum meam prouinciam. 190

ME. Polliceor operam.
ΜΕ. Domi:

indicarem. Cf. redderent, red-
deres, 133.
181. neque adeo: asomewhat
frequent combination, 918, Capt-
348, in which adeo has lost some-
thing of its proper force; ‘ not
surely,’ ‘and certainly . . . not?
182. illi: Charmides. The
tautology of red-emi russum
would not be felt more than in
the EngL, “I have bought it
back again.'' Both rursum and
russum are well supported by the
185. em: not to be confused,
as it is in Harper’s Lexicon, with
hem, the emotional interjection,
or with the interrogative en. It
is of demonstrative origin and is
used with demonstrative force3
with other demonstratives‚ as in
vs. 3, with adverbS‚ em nunc, with
νει-δε, em desino, with impv., em
uide, and as here with an acc. of
exclamation. The acc. might

stand alone, but by association

CA. Ergo ubi eris paulo post?

with em it is felt to be in some
degree dependent upon it. —
There is an unexplained and per-
haps incorrect hiatus after male-
facta.

186 may serve as an example
of the cases in which the two
families of MSS. (Introd. 6) give
different readings, either of which
would suit the place. The line is

‘printed as it is found in the Milan

palimpsest. In the Palatine MSS.
it is an exclamation: Hascz'ne
[me] propter res mdledicas fama‘s

ferunt. — ferunt, circulate.

187. παῦσαιε perhaps this stood
in the Greek play at this point and
was brought over by Plautus with-
out translation in order to highten
the effect by the sudden introduc-
tion of a foreign word. Cf. οἴχεται,
419.

190. prouinciam: largely used
in Pl. of any duty or business;
here of the guardianship of the
treasure.
