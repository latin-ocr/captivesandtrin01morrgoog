132 PLAVTI

[11. 4. 138.

Nam fulguritae sunt alternae Ι arbores:

Sues moriuntur angina Ι acerrume ε

540

Oues scabrae sunt, tarn glabrae, em, quam haec est manus,
Tum autern Syrorum, genus quod patientissumumst
Hominum, nemo exstat qui lbi sex menses uixerit:

Ita cuncti solstitiali morbo decidunt.

PH. Credo ego istuC, Stasime‚ ita esse: sed Campans

545

Multo Syrorum iam antidit patientia.

Sed istest ager profect0‚ ut te audiui loqui,
Malos in quern omnes publice mitti decet.
Sicut fortunatorum memorant InsulaS,

Quo cuncti qui aetatem egerint caste suam

550

Conueniant ε contra istoc detrudi maleficos
Aequom uidetur, qui quidem'istius sit modi.
ST. Hospitiumst calamitatis: quid uerbis opust?

539. The hiatus after alternae
has been avoided by various con-
jectures, alternas (nom. plu.,
Ritschl), alternis (Spengel), no
one of which is entirely satisfac-
tory. It is possible that anginad
⁶ with the old d of the abl. prevented
hiatus in the next ys.

pagna, which is especially preva-
lent during the heat of summer
(solstz'ttkcm).

545. Campans genus: a Ro-
man allusion, added by Plautus.
During the operations of 212—
211 B.c. some of ·the Campa-
nian towns opened their gates to
Hannibal and the Campanians
acted as his allies in the defense
of Capua. This passage, which
implies that Campanian slaves
were used as farm laborem, ex-
presses the Roman hostility to the
allies who had revolted, and some

special slur‚ which we cannot now
undlersltand, is no doubt contained
in t e ines.

547. sed ε resuming the thought
after the interruption of 545 f.—
ut . . . audiui: Introd. 33 a.

549. The reference to the
“isles of the blessed ’⁹ is of course
from the Greek original, as are
all allusions to Greek myth and
leg—5e5nrdnf. istoc, istius modi: with
the proper 2d pers. force, to the
place you speak qf, such as you de-
clare it to be.—-quidem adds a
restrictive force to qui and with
istius gives an ironical color to
the clause3 ‘supposing, that is,
that lt 1s such as you. say that it
IS· 553. hospitiumst calamitatis:
cf. damna conciliabolum, 314. Such
vivid and humorous phrases show
Plautus at his best, as a master in
the conversational style.
