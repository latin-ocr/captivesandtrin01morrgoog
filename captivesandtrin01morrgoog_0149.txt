ADVLESCENS

Multas res simitu in meo corde u6r50‚
Multum ln cogitando dolorem indipiscor.

Egomet me coquo et macero et defetlgo:

225

Magister mihi exercitor animus minc est.
Sed hoc non liquet neque satis cogitatumst,
Vtram potius harum mihi artem expetessam,

221. The subjunctives are all
due to the influence of the preced-
ing conditions. sint is used para-
tactically with faxim 3 Introd. 26.
—faxim z the optative form of the
sigmatic aorist, as if for sac—caestu.
See Capt. 124 n.

Megaronides returns to his own
house and the stage is left vacant
for a moment. As no change of
scenery or costume was required,
there was no considerable pause
in the action.

THIRD SCENE. The actor,
dressed in rich and bright-colored
clothing to represent a young man,
comes upon the stage from the
door of his father’s house. This
indicates to the spectators that he
must be a citizen, and the action
of the play is so simple that no
other introduction is necessary.

The following canticum (Introd.
4) is written in varying meters.
Of these certain parts (ega, 223-
232, 242—-256, 271-27 5) fall easily
into bacchic or cretic measureS‚
and here and there single good
vss. appear (233-234 iambic sep-
ten„ 253 trochaic septem), but
large parts appear in the MSS. in

such form that they can be reduced
to meter only by many and violent
changes. Such passages present
metrica] and critical problems
which, without further knowledge
of Roman music and dancing, are
not likely to be solved. In the
text as printed these passages are
not marked with accents.

224. indipiscor contains the
old form of the prepos. indu,
which appears also in a few other
compounds‚ indaudire, induo, in-
dae-eo, indzgrena, industria, indupe-
rator (Enn.‚ Lucr.)‚ etc.

225. coquo e't macero: cf.
Quint. XII. 10. 77, sollicitudo ora-
torem macerat et coquit, and the
quotation from Ennius, . . . cu-
ram . . . quae nunc te coquit, at
the beginning of Cic. de Senect.

226. magister exercitet, train-
ing· master, perhaps a translation
of παιδοτρίβης, as Brix suggests.
Cf. seruos homo for the combina-
tion of two nouns into a single
idea.

228 ff. artem, princzffle, refer-
ring to the choice in 230 between
surrender to pleasure and regard
for the serious inte-rests of life. -
