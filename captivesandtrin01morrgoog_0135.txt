TRINVMMVS 93

Nam hic nimium morbus mores inuasit bonos:

Ita plerique omnis iam sunt intermortui.

Sed dum ssli aegrotant, interim mores mali 30
Quasi herba inrigua succreuere uberrume:

Eorum licet iam metere messem maxumam

Neque quicquam hic nunc est usse· nisi mores mali.

N imioque hic pluris pauciorum gratiam

Faciunt pars hominum quam id quod prosint pluribus, 35
Ita uincunt illud conducibile gratiae,

Quae in rebus multis opstant odiossaeque sunt
Remoramque faciunt rei priuatae et publicae.

28. hic: this would be under-
stood by speaker and audience to
mean here in Rome, but it does
not follow that lines like these
may not have stood in the Greek
original of the Trinummus. Re-
flections upon the degeneracy of
the times are found in many pla s
(aga, 1028 ff„ Δία. Glor. 673 .;
Men. 571 ff), and belong rather
to comedy in general than to any
particular comedy or any particu-
lar society or age. The phrase
pauciorum gratiam would per·
haps apply somewhat more easily
to Roman politics than to Greek.
—nimiumz usually means in Pl.
ἔῖἤηῖἔὲἔίιῗοὶεέἕ 2⁸22& {²222
meaning too much is rare.

29· ita: this does not go with
intermortui, but with the whole
clause, and, without losing its
proper force, expresses the reason
for the preceding statement. The
use is very common in Pl.; Bacch.
18, Praenestinum opino esse .· ita
erat glon'osus, I think he 's a Prae-
nestine, be 's such a braggart;
Amph. 626, qui, malum, intellegere
quisquam potis est? ita nugas

blatis, you ’re talking such nom-ense.
——plerique omnes: this combi-
nation is found also in Ter. Phorm.
1723 Andr. 55 (1. 1. 28) where
Donatus comments upon it and
supports it b{ a quotation from
Naevius and y a comparison of
the Greek πάμπολλοι. Cf. “ they
mostly all do it.” Such phrases
are the result of colloquial exag-
geration.

31. quasi: in a real compari-
son. See n. on Capt. 80.

33. uile: perhapsareference to
high prices prevailing in Rome at
the time the play was written, but
it may equally well have come
from the Greek play. Cf. n.
on 28, above, and hac annona,

3 5. faciunt pars hominum: a
construction in which the sense
overrides the strict grammatical
agreement of subject and verb.
Cf. Most. 114 f., magna pars . . .
induxerunt ,· cf. Cape. 501 n.

36. gratiae: see Introd. 13 a.

37. odiossae=odiosae; cf. oti-
osse, 1077. These are occasional
preservations of the earlier form
of this suffix, -onsus, -ossus, isus.
