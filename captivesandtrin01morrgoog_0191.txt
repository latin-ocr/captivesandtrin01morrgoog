ΜΕ. Quo pacto ergo igitur clam dos depromi potest?
CA. Dum occasio ei rei reperiatur, interim

Ab amico alicunde mutuom argentum rogem.

, ΜΕ. Potin est ab amico alicunde exorari? CA. Potest.
ΜΕ. Gerrae : ne tu illud uerbum actutum inueneris: 760
‘ Mihi quidem hercle non est quod dem mutuom!

CA. Malim hercle ut uerum dicas quam ut des mutuom.

ME. Sed uide consilium sl placet. CA. Quid consilist?

ME. Scitum, ut ego opinor, consilium inueni. CA.
Quid est?

ME. Homo conducatur aliquis iam quantum potest. 765

755. neu=et κω cf. Pseud.
“’ 322, ne illam uendas neu me perdas,
that you should not sell lter and
(thereby) destroy r'ne. — si dixe-
· rim: the condition goes only with
indaget.

756. ergo igitur: this doubling
of the adverb, which in general is
characteristic of Plautus, is made
easier by the fact that agitur still
retains much of its original de-
monstrative force. Transl. the
two together, then.

7 58. alicunde ε here almost the
same as ab amico aliqum though
less definite. It is used with a

765. iarn quantum potest go
together; ‘ as soon as possible!

766 ff. These vss. are hopelessly
confused in the MSS. and no
attempt is made in the text either
to restore· the original reading
(which is impossible) or to rewrite
the passage. The general sense
is: ‘ Let some man be hired as
soon as possible and dressed care-
fully (graphice) to look like a
foreigner. Let him be a man
whose face is unknown here (non
