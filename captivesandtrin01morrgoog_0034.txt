m INTRODUCTION.

33. In subordinate clauses ut is used for the most part as
in classica} Latin. There are some idiomS.

a) ut audio, etc„ “to judge by what I hear ” : Ps. 99, ut . . . ›ser-
monem audio, “to judge by the talk ”3 Most. 993, ut uerba audio ;
Capt. 569, ut rem uideo; 585, ut perspicio, ‘⁴ by what I see.’'

b) ut causal (the logical ground): Bacch. 106, nam ut in naui
uecta's, credo timida's3 Most. 268, ut speculum tenuisti, metuo
. . .; Ps. 278, atque in pauca, ut occupatus nunc sum, confer quid
uelis· Only a few caseS, and sometimes otherwise explained.

c) Many ‚verbs which in classica] Latin are rarely or never followed
by ut take an obj eet clause with ut in Pl. ε mereri, tempus est, melius
est, optumum est, causa est, officium est, meminisse, dicere, scire,
retinere, etc.

d) The uses in independent sentences are more remarkable3 in
wishes: Aul. 785, ut illurn di . . . perduint ; Poen. 912, ualeas bene-
que ut tibi sit, = utinam3 in repudiating questions: Ps. 516, egone
ut cauere nequeam3 Aul. 690, egone ut te aduersum mentiar; ex-
clamatory or interrogative: Ps. 911, ut it, ut magnifice infert sese ;
Ps. 944, ut ego . . . te amo, etc., and very frequently.

34· a) The correlative dum occurs once : Truc. 232, dum habeat,
dum (MSS. tum) amet ; cf. Catullus, 62. 45, 56.

b) The enclitic dum with the impv. is very common : faedam, mane-
dum, tacedum, iubedum, etc. In classical Latin only agedum is pre-
' served; but·cf. nondum, uixdum.

35· a) Plautus uses a great variety of conditional sentences; with
the different tenses of the indie. 21 combinations, with the subjunc. in
both clauses 7, of “ mixed forms ” (indic. and subjunc. or subjunc. impf.
with subjunc. pres., etc.) 12 or 13, with impv. or jussive subjunc. 19.
In many cases a potential force is evident in protasis or apodosiS.

b) Condition contrary to fact (unfulfilled) with pres. or perf. subjunc. :
Ps. 274, misereat, si familiam alere possim misericordia: Asin.
393, si sit dorni, dicam tibi; Asin. 188, si ecastor nunc habeas
quod dee, alia uerba praehibeas : nunc quia nil habes, ‘⁴ if you had
anything to give, . . . : but as you have n’t anything ”3 Epid. 331 ; Most.
5 5 5; Pers. 21 53 Bacch. 635, etc. Of these conditions there are some 15
to 20 cases.

, c) Condition contrary to fact with impf. indic. : Rud. 379, quid
faceret ? ΙΙ si amabat, rogas quid faceret ἲ adseruaret . . . ; Men.
