114 PLAVTI [11. 2. 2 5.

Vtrum itane esse ‘mauelit ut eum animus aequom
censeat,

An ita potius 1'1t parentis eum esse et cognati uelint:

Si animus hominem pepulit, actumst, animo seruit, non
sibi:

Si ipse animum pepulit, dum uiuit, uictor uictorum
cluet. ’

Tu si animum uicisti potius quam animus te, est quod
gaudeas 310

Nimio satiust ut opust te ita esse quam ut animo lubet.

(Qui Animum uincunt quam quos animus semper pro-
biores cluent.)

LY. istaec ego mihi semper habui aetati integumen-

tum meae,
Ne penetrarem me usquam, ubi esset damni concilia-
bolum, 314

Ne noctu irem obambulatum neti suom adimerem alteri.

306. utrum with double ques-
tions retains in Pl. much of its
original sense, which qf the two.

307. For a moment the figure
changes and the parents and rela-
tives stand for the man's own
better choiee. The next lines re-
turn to the original idea.

308 f. actumst and uiuit are
contrasted, and seruit and uictor.
There are familiar Engl. phrases
like uictor uictorum and cf. regum
rex, Capt. 82 5. For the thought,
cf. Hor. Ep. Ι. 2. 62, animum rege,
qui nisi paret, imperat.

31 1. nimie, much ,· see Capt. 102
n. This is the regular sense in Pl.

312 is a mere repetition of the
thought of 309. It uses the plural
while all the rest of the speech has
been in the singular, and instead
of probiores we should expect

probi with cluent, which contains

in itself the idea of eminence
which the comparative here would
give. The vs. is plainly a gloss
Not so 311, which is a real sum-
mary of the preceding.

313. istaec: i.e., such precepts
as those which you have been ex-
pressing with the reference to the
second person proper to iste. -—
aetati ε not as in the frequent use
of aetas mea = ego, but with refer-
ence to adulescentia 301, ine-
unte aetate 305.

314. conciliabulum: perhaps
here a translation of σύλλογος, as
irem obambulatum may be of
κωμάζειν. The opening scene of the
Bacchides is the best commentary
on these lines, esp. 66, penetrem
me huiusmodi in palaestram, ubi
dam nis desudascitur Ρ
