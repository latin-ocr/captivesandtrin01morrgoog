Ciiue sis tibi ne bubuli in te cottabi crebri crepent,

Si aberis ab eri quaestione: ne destiteris currere.

Ecce hominem te, Stasime, nili: satin in thermipolio
Condalium es oblituS, postquam thermopotasti gut-

turem ?
Recipe te et recurre petere re recenti. CH. Huic,

1011. The κότταβος consisted
in throwing the last drops of wine
from a cup into a metal basin in
such a way as to produce a ringing
sound. — cottabi bubuli are the
blows of the ox·hide lashes. Cf.

uuiae, Most. 882. ·

1013 f. ecce : Stasimus sudden-
ly remembers the ring which he
has left behind at the wine shop.
The therntt'p0lt'um (θερμοπώλιον)
was a shop (popina) where hot
drinks were sold to slaves. —
thermopotasti : not a vox hybrida,
as Harper’s Lexicon has it, from
θερμός and penam, because the o is
short here. Perhaps from a Greek
form θερμοπστεῖν. The sense is, ‘ to
warm the throat with hot drinks.’

cf. Capt. 357 n.

his desire for drink led him to
run to the wine shop and now the
forgetfulness caused by drinking
compels him to run back again.

1018. memoriam: the acc. is
regular in Pl. after obliuiscor. —
There is hiatus after frugi, for
which no satisfactory emendation
has been proposed.

1020. The names are printed as
they stand in the MSS„ though
they do not make a metrical line.
It is useless to attempt to get the
original form or meaning.

1021. collierepidae: from col·
lum and crepare, slaves who wore
a metal collar about the neck3 cf.
boia, Capt. 888. The other words
are explained in Harper’s Lexicon.

Capt. 472, plagipatidae.
