xxvi INTRODU CTION.

d) Infin. after aegrotus, occupatus, defessus, immemor, neglegens,
forming a verbal phrase with est: Ps. 1104; Most. 141 ; Trin. 76, etc.
Cf. Horace's very free use of the complementary infinitive after
adjectiveS.

DIRECT QUEsTmNS. ’

25· a) ¹ne has sometimes almost the effect of nonne (which is rare
in Pl.): so with sumne followed by rel. clause, estne in recognition
(Bacch. 534, estne hic meus sodalis ?); indic. perf. first sing. (Ps. 489,
dixin . . . dudum tibi? “did n’t I tell you so?’'); Rud. 8653 Merc.
5883 Capt. 595, etc.

b) num, numquis do not always expect a negative answer: Amph.
1073, numnam hunc percussit Iuppiter? credo edep013 Men. 620,
num ancillae aut serui tibi responsant? eloquere: inpune non
erit 3 Men. 4133 Amph. 709, 753, etc. This use of num is not infre-
quent in later Latin.

. c) an is largely used in independent (not disjunctive) questions ε Ps.
309, te uiuom uellem. ΙΙ eho, an iam mot-tuost? Adest. 454, paene
confregi . . . foris. ΙΙ eho, an tu tetigisti has aedis Ρ Capt. 680, 257,
629, etc. No single English word will translate an in all cases.

Α d) Questions with urgency have sometimes impv. effect: abin in
malam rem? “go to the deuce1” atque audin? “do you hear?''
ecquis aperit ἲ “let some one open ’'; non taces ἲ “ keep still.’'

PARATAX1S.

26. There are three degrees of closeness in the relation
between two ideas τ They may be independent or so nearly
independent that language has no means of expressing the
relation more precisely than by coordinating words, et, sed,
mque,- or one may be distinctly dependent upon the other,
so that the relation is expressed by a subordinating word,
qui, quom, ut, ubi‚· or they may be in an intermediate stage,
one depending in thought upon the other, but in a relation for
which language has not as yet developed any exact expres-
sion. This stage is called parataxis ,· ¹ all forms of subordi-

1 That is, coordination, Beiordnung; but coordination is technically
used of the connection of sentences by conjunctions.
