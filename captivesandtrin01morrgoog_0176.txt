573. quid istic Ρ used, more fre-
quently by Terence than by Plau-
tus, to indicate that the speaker
gives way to the arguments of an·-
other. Donatus (on Ter. Ad. Ι. 2.
53) says deest ‘ loquor ’ aut· resisto':
nam proprie est de sententia sua
decedentis. istic is the adv. with
2d pers. force and agam or dicam
or some such general verb is to be
supplied. ‘ What can I say to
that? ’ Plautus has quid istic
uerba facimus ? Epid. 141, with the
same sense.

576. di fortunabunt: a wish.
Cf. Introd. 21 c, 447 n. -ita uolo,
I hope so.

578. hoc negoti ε the object of
dic and not the subject of ac-
tumst, which is impersonal. The
phrase quo modo actumst is ex-
planatory of hoe negoti, and
therefore has the indic„ as it
would have if it depended directly
upon dic. For true prolepsis of
the subject of the subordinate
clause, with the subjunc., cf. 88;

87 3; Merc. 137, eloquere id negoti
quid siet. — To the first command
Stasimus returns a proper assent,
ibitur ; to the second, which
seems to him unnecessary, his re-
ply is more off-hand, scilicet, ῳ(
course ‚· the third and fourth touch
the subject of the dowry, and to
these and to the following protes-
tations he answers only, quin tu i
modo, i modo, abi modo, phrases
of dissatisfaction and incredulity,
Oh J go 'zqayl Get out! only a
little stronger than apage, 525. So
in Poen. 428 ff. a slave interrupts
his master’s protestations with i
modo, abi mode, etiamne abis ? and
abiturun es ? And it is very com-
mon for a slave to order his young
master out of the way as a mere
obstruction to the plot.

581. eadem (sc. opera), at the
same time; lit„ with the same effert.
Cf. Capt. 450, blost. 1039, etc„
where opera is expressed. This
should be distinguished from una
opera qua, just as well.
