INTRODUCTION. xxix

29· a) quom explicative, after expressions of emotion, etc„ has the
indic: Capt. 297, fecit officium hic suom, quom tibist confessus
uerum ; Most. 149, cor dolet, quom scio; Men. 1148, quom tu’s
liber, gaudeo; Most. 719, amice faciS, quom me laudas, Translate
“ that,” ‘⁴ in that,” without temporal force, and cf. quod, quia. This use
of quom (cum) occurs in Cicero.

b) The temporal clause with the impf. and plupf. subjunctive is
not yet in use in Pl. The temporal quom-clauses with pres. or perf.
subjunc. are either independent subjunctives (potential, indefinite
second pers.) or are subjanc. by attraction: Ps. 137, quos quom
feriaS, tibi plus noceas 3 Amph. 542, ut, quom absim, me ames;
Ps. 168, ne mora quae sit, cocus quom ueniat, about fifty cases,

- With these (apparent) exceptions the temporal quom-clause in Pl.

always has the indic„ about 22 5 cases.

c) quom causal-adversative may have the subjunc. in some three or
four cases (Capt. 8923 Ps. 184 ); it has the subjunc. by attraction a few
timeS, but regularly quom causal-adversative takes the indic. ε Bacch.
1005, sat sic suspectus sum, quom careo noxia3 Capt. 244, quom
antehac pro iure imperitabam meo, nunc te oro per precem.

30· quoniam has in a few cases pure temporal meaning: Trin. 149,
quoniam hinc profectust . . . thensaurum demonstrauit mihi3
Ml. 129, quoniam inspexi mulieris sententiam, cepi tabellas ς
Asin. 3 5o; Trin. 14; Capt. 930.

31. quod in Pl. is rarely, if ever, causal.

a) As a conjunction it is scarcely to be distinguished from the pron.
in acc. of compass and extent: Ps. 9, quid est, quod tu . . . gestas
tabellas tecum . . .? Merc. 364, quid illuc est, quod solus secum
fabulatur filius ? and often with quid est quod.

b) With verbs of emotion (cf. quom) ι Capt. 996, quod male feci,
crucior; Mil. Glor. 469, nimis beat, quod conmeatus transtinet3
Poen. 1373, ne mirere, mulieres quod eum sequntur. This is also
found in later Latin.

32· quia is usually causal; there are more than 2 50 cases against
possibly half a dozen of quod causal. After verbs of emotion: Capt.
prol· 59, ne uereamini quia . . . dixi; Capt. 203, at nos pudet, quia
cum catenis sumus; Mil. 1222, laetast, quia ted adiit 5 Mil. 1328,
· lacrumo, quia diiungimur.
