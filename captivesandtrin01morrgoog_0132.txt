PROLOGVS

LVXVRIA ΙΝΟΡῙΔ

Lv. Sequere hac me, gnata, ut munus fungaris tuom.
IN. Sequor: sed finem fore quem dicam nescio,

Lv. Adest : em illae sunt aedes: i intro nunciam.
Nunc, nequis erret uostrum paucis 1'n uiam

Deducam, si quidem operam dare promittitis, 5

The other prologues are for the
most part spoken by a special
Prologus and consist of long intro-
ductions to the action of the play,
varied by rather heavy witticisms.
A few are spoken by mythological
personageS, Mercurius (Amph.),
Arcturus (Rud.); the Lar Fami·
liaris is the speaker in the Aul.
and Auxilium in the Cist. No
other prologue brings two speak-
3311233. {issgssssifa‘i &1¹22 2311?ss
and no other is so artistic in its
form and its relation to the play.
It is probably from the Greek
original.

Other prologues were considet-
ably changed and interpolated at
the time of the first Plautine re-
vival, 150-50 B.c.; the only vss.
here which are certainly not by
Plautus are 18-21, which injure
the form and interrupt the thought.
It is possible that 6, 7 also are a
later interpolation; nunc igitur
primum repeats very awkwardly
the nunc of 4 and primum of 8,
and si quid-em . . . promittitis

is exactly the same as si animum
aduortitiS.

1. sequere hac: a common
combination (Rud. 1843 Men.
5625 Capt. 764, etc.), which with
the answer sequor should be ren·
dered colloquially. — fungaris:

·only a few cases of the 2d sing.

pass. in —ris occur in Pl.; the end-
ing -re is frequent. The acc. with
fungor is regular in early Latin;
see Introd. 16 b.

2. dicam: see n. on · Capt. 268.

3. adest: sc. finis sequendi.—
nunciam ε when it is one word, it
is always in three syllables, and
is used only in commands, with
impv., subjunc„ or fut. in impv.
sense, or rarely with a true future.
It is in sense a strengthened nunc,
and distinct from the two words
nunc iam, which mean now at last,'
in contrast with some other past
time.

5. operam dare: see n. on
Capt- 6. On the omission of uos
and the use of pres. for fut. infin.
after a verb of promising, see
Introd. 24 a, b.
