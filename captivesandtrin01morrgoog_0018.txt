xiv INTRODUCTION. -

lacked the poetic imagination, is a just distinction. There
is slight evidence in Plautus of feeling for nature or of pro-
found interest in man and his relation to life. From politics
he was doubtless shut out by police regulationS, and as his
prime object was to furnish amusement, any serious contem-
plation of life was aside from his purpose. Yet the fact
must be recognized that the plays show not so much an
intentional avoidance of serious thought as an entire insen-
sibility to it, and reveal plainly the limited range within
which the mind of the writer moved. The semi-lyrical
cantica, like Trin. 22 3—27 5, would have afforded to a poet an
opportunity for something finer and truer than the rather
vague lines which Plautus has written.

But granting these limitations ot' mind and experience‚ it
is not difficult to discover the qualities which made the
comedies of Plautus popular. Varro's judgment was in
argumentis (plots) Caecilius poscit palmam, in ethesin (draw-
ing of character) Terentius, in sermonibus (dialogue) Plautus.
When they are at their best, the dialogue soenes express the
character and situation of the speakers without seeming to
do so; they abound in puns and joking hits; they move
quickly and lightly, and, above all else, they give the
impression that the writer is observing his characters with a
· humorous sense of their absurditieS. Further, the intrigue
which forms the basis of the plot is often in itself farcical
and amusing, and the characterS, though they are less finely
conceived than those of Terence, prove their truth by the
fact that they are perfectly intelligible to ηε, across all the
barriers of race and the differences in civilization. In read-
ing the plays the reader must constantly keep in mind the
fact that they were written for the stage and need the help
of gesture and look and intonation to aid the interpretation.

conversational Latin of his time, it is more nearly correct
