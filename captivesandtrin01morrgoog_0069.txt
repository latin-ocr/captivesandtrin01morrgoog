286 ff. Hegio understands that
Thens. is only a nickname‚ and
from the composition guesses at
the meaning; Philoc. corrects his
guess in 287 and in 288 gives him
the real name. The use of all
this in 633 is an afterthought. See
n. on 635. There is no reason
why the real name should be con-
cealed, nor is there any point to
the following vss. except that they

287. audaciam: from auidus,

after ne, st, num.

291. Samiis: of common earth-
enware instead of silver. Cf. Cic.
pro Mur. 75, exposuit uasa Samia,
given as proof of Tubero's shab-
bines5.

2.92 subrupiat = surripiat ,· cf.
aucupo, exsulto, etc, from stems

923 eadem (sc. opera), at the
