401. These words introduce
Lesbonicus to the audience.

F 1 FT H S c EN E. Lesbonicus
comes out from the side-street be·
tween the houses of Philto and
Callicles, followed by his slave
StasimuS, to whom he is talking.
For the first thirty lines Philto
stands at one side, listenin g to the
others and unperceived by them.

402. quindecim dies: a round

number, like ten days or a sort-
mght.

404. estne . .. ? isn’t it. . . ἕ
This sense of -ne, almost like
nonne, is found with est in ques-
tions which challenge the hearer
to aeknowledge an evident fact;
usually some form of hic or a sub-
ordinate clause involving an asser-
tion (ut dixi, ut dato, quod dico)
accompanies the question. The
reply of Stasimus is intentionally
careless, as though the matter was
one of small interest to him.

405. ee, it, the money. Capt.
222 n. For the case, see Introd.
17 a.

406. ext-z like the Engl. up,
with similar verbs. — exunctum :
Roman customs made this item of
expense a large one; cf. 2 52, where
unctor is named second in the list.
