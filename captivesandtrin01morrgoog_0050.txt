56. immemorabiles, which
should not be spoken, from the
sense of memorare, speak‚ tell,
which is the usual one in Pl.

60. foris illic extra scaenam:
this kind of pleonasm belongs
properly to colloquial style, and
is therefore very common in PL:
illic ibi, 10003 ibidem in Alide, 26;
pone aedem Castoris ibi, Cure. 4813
tum egitur, egitur demum, etc.;
Introd. 10.

61. paene iniquomst, quite un-
just. For this sense of paene, cf.
Mil. 408 f., paene perdt'dtlrti, . . .
absumptu’s paene ,· Rud. 1204, ni·
mis paene; Aul. 466, paenissume.
—choragioz the costumes and
stage properties suitable for a
comedy could not be used for a
tragedy. choragus is the contrac-
tor who provided costumeS, Trin.
858, and n.; Curc. 464.

67. iudices: this can be used
only in a general way, ‘ judges of
comedy,' for except Trin. 706, uicit
tua comoedia, and a few appeals
like the present, there is nothing
in the plays or in the didascaliae

which points to regular contests
between different authors, as in
Greece.

68. duelli, duellatores=belli,
bellatores. So in many inser. and -
in old laws. Cf. duonoro=bono=
rum, in the second Scipio epitaph,
Duelonai= Bellonae, S. C. de Bac„
and bis for duis.

The prologue cannot be wholly
by Plautus. Vs. 12, with the ref-
erence to fixed seatS, cannot be
earlier than 146 B.c., when perma-
nent seats were first introduced.
With 12 must go 1 1-16, and prob-
ably 8-10 also. Vss. 21—22 are
out of place where they stand,

they fit in well, though Brix puts
them after 4. Vss. 46—49 and 50-

therefore, it is impossible to reach
certain conclusions in such a mat-
