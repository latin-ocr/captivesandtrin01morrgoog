mihi :

606. dices: the future idea lies
in credibile, though expressed in
the verb, as if it were ‘ What you
ῗίῖἕ »Ἥιῗὲῒυξὲοἴὲ ῃῖἳῐῖξέεῗυέἓὲ
in comedy, eg„ Mil. Glor. 395,
narrandum ego istuc militi censebo
(where the future idea is expressed
-twice); Mil. 1209, deos sperabo
teque, i.e., ‘I hope that you and
the gods will help me.'— nullus:
used colloquially as a perhaps
stronger equivalent of non, ne,·
so especially in nullus sum, which
Donatus (Ter. And. ΙΙΙ. 4. 20)
says is stronger than perii.

607. me nili pendere, that I
don’t care, i.e., whether you believe
it or not.

608. ilico.
quently of time, but also of place,
especially in combination with hic,
right here. This passage allows
either sense3 ilico may answer
quam dudum and hic ante os-
tium would answer ubi. [So

tam modo the answer, in reversed
order, to quam dudum.

609. tam modo: the correct
Latin would be modo. Cf. Truc.
691, where conca or conia is said to
be the Praenestine form for ciconia.
Cf. Campans= Campanus, 545.

610. frugalior: ironieally, since
Callicles thought that L esbouieus
was refusing to give the dowry
and was intending to use the price
of the property for his own pleas-
ures. The positive frugalis does
not occur in class. Latin, frugi,
indecl„ being used in its place.
Quintilian (I.6. 17) says that the
use ofsrugalis was offensive ped-
antry (molestissima diligentiae per-
uersitas). But frugalior, fruga-

litas, frugaliter show that it must ’

once have been in use.
611. atque: cf. 336 n.; Capt.
355 n.—- filio: dat. of advantage.
613. postremo, in short. This
line and the following one are
spoken aside-
