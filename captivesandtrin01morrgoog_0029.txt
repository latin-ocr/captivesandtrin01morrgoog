INTRODUCTION. xxv

SUBJUNCTIVE.

22. The uses of the subjunctive in independent sentences
in Plautus differ from those in later Latin mainly in being
more direct, as is natural in conversation. Many cases of
the subjunctive in clauses grammatically subordinate are in
fact independent; ag. .-

Mil. Glor. 1034, at scin quid tu facias ? True potential uses are
rather infrequent.

IMPERATIVE.

23· a) The present and the future are generally clearly distin-
guished. The future is used chiefly in connection with fut. indic.
When pres. and fut. are used together they express two successive acts:
Ps. 20, cape has tabellas: tute hinc narrato tibi, “take this letter
and (then) tell yourself the story ”; Ps. 31, 161, etc. Examples are
abundant.

b) Beside the various periphrastic equivalents of the impv„ fac,
uide, cura, and the ‚expressions of prohibition with noli, caue, mitte,
and the perf. subjunc. with ne, Pl. uses also pres. subjunc. addressed to
a definite person (Capt. 186, ne postules; Asin. 469, molestus ne sis,
and often) and preS. impv. with ne : Amph. 530, ne corrumpe oeulos 3
Asin. 377, ne nega, etc.

INFINITIVE.

24· a) Pres. is used for fut. after verbs of promising, etc.: Merc.
631, promittebas te os sublinere meo patri 3 Asin. 699, hoc argen-
tum ferre speres3 also after dare, adiurare, minari, etc.

b) Infin. is found instead of acc. with infin. after verbs of saying.
when the subject is the same asthat'of the main verb: Trin. 956,
aibat mandasse ς Capt. 256, cauisse ratus est 3 Capt. 194, ire dixe-
ram3 Men. 539, dicam curare? = te curaturum esse (different
subject).

c) The infin. of purpose is used after verbs of motion: Most. 67,
ire . . . uolo . . . parare3 Trin. 1015, recurre petere; Bacch. 631,
. . . uenerat aurum petere; and after curro, abeo, exe0, mitto. This
construction is found also in poetry (Verg. Aen. I. 527, non . . . Libycos

populare penatis uenimus) and is not an imitation of the Greek con-
struction:
