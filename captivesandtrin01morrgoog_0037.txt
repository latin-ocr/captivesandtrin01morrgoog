INTRODUCTION. xxxiii

&tunt in third plu. perf. indic. Most of these occur rarely, and they
have a few parallels in Horace and Vergil: timet, uelit, steterunt, etc.

44. The strongest influence in producing differences
between the prosody os Plautus and that of Horace and
Vergil was exerted by the accent. The Latin usage which
tended to fix the accent upon 'the penult or antepenult, with-
drew from the ultima a preservative force, and expedited the
shortening and ‘dropping off of inflectional endingS. This
process went on during the whole history of the language,
but it was much more rapid and extended in the spoken
than in the written Latin. For this reason, though he
preceded Vergil by a century and a half, Plautus has many
more cases of syllables shortened by the⁸ accent than any
Augustan poet.

45· Iambic words (φ -) are frequently shortened to pyri-hies
(ύ υ), whether the last syllable ends in a vowel or 3 consonant. So
domi, ηδιιδ, noua, boul, u111; the imperatives abl, ῒέιιέ, um, hibe,
fimi, etc.; and before consonantS, dedln, ιιῖῐδε, ΡῐὸοἰὶῙ, Ρέϊῦιιι, caput,
rogat, senex, etc. In mihi, tibi, sibi, ubi the influence ot* the accent
makes the last syllable occasionally short (common) even in classical
poetry, and regularly henli, mile. Examples of this are very common,
and in inscriptions the final consonant of some of these words is
omitted. But when the word is emphatic and therefore distinetly pro-
nounced the final syllable may preserve its length, nale, abi.

46· In the verse of Plautus the metrical ictus may exert the same
influence as the word-aecem, when it falls upon the short syllable of an
iambic combination. This is most frequent with short monosyllables ,
followed by a long monosyllable or by a word the first syllable of which
is long· fs list, fin Ille, 1³81 1ι1ὀ, quod fn manu, pgr hanc, iit hunc, qul‘s
haec, etc-3 or with elision, tfbi ergo, qusa in re, nfsi hlium with longer
words, ςιιὸᾶ ὅοδὶιιίῐ, quid exprobras, {ge accumbe, quud intellexi,
mage innortales, quid abstulisti, etc.

4·'7 Further, the effect of the ictus is sometimes exerted backwards,
so as to shorten a preceding long syllable, when that syllable is itself
preceded by a short syllable. Thus dedisse exponendm, sed lstfic,
Ego essclsidor, bonum ingenium, ad uxorem, per annonam, ln occulto,
