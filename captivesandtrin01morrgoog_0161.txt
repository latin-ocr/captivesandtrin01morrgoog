11. 2. 90.]

Qui sslic habitat. PH. Quin comedit quod fuit, quod
non fuit? 360

LY. Ne opprobra, pater : multa eueniunt homini quae
uolt, quae neuolt.

ΡΗ. Mentire edepol, gnate, atque id nunc facis haud
consuetudine.

Nam sapiens quidem pol ipsus fingit fortunam sibi ε

Eo non multa quae neuolt eueniunt, nisi fictor malust.

LY. Multa illi opera opust ficturae qui se fictorem

probum ³65
Vitae agundae esse expetit ε sed hic admodum adu·
lescentulust.

ΡΗ. Non aetate, uerum ingenio apiscitur sapientia.

Sapienti aetas condimentum, sapiens aetati cibust.

Agedum eloquere, quid dare illi nunc uis? LY. Nil
quicquam, pater:

Tu modo ne me prohibeas accipere, siquid det mihi. 370

PH. An eo egestatem ei tolerabiS‚ siquid ab illo acceperis ?

360. quin=quine. The parti-
cle -ne is appended to the relative
when the main clause containing
the antecedent is omitted, but
would have been interrogative if it
had been expressed. Here, Do you
mean the young man who. . . ? So
Amph. 6973 Epid. 719; 'Rud.
861 3 1019; 1231, etc. In a few
cases -ne is appended to the rela-
tive when the relative clause pre-
cedes the main clause.

362. mentire (pres. indic. zd
sing.) is not an accusation of false-
hood; it means only that is not so
or you 're- not speaking accurately,
as you usually do.

363 ff. fingit, fictor, fictur-ae ε
properly of the shaping of clay
figures ς fingere is a common word
and is used here without much

thought of the proper sense, then,
as the figure grows clearer it leads
to fictor and the young man fi-
nally uses opera ficturae most
clearly in the highest sense, the
sculptor's art.

367. apiscitur: pass. from api-
sco ,· cf. infimis-cet, Asin. 279. Other
verbs are at times active in Pl.
which later became deponent, eg„
opino, arbitro, aucupa, proficis-co
(onlgrgonce), etc.

3 . The thought is, ‘Age is
but a slight addition, a mere flavor-
ing, to wisdom, but wisdom is
absolutely necessary to age ; with-
out wisdom age would not be
worthy of respect.' The use of
the concrete sapiens with the ab·

straet aetas makes the expression
a little hard.
