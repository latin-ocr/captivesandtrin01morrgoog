INTRODUCTION. . xxiii

c) eedem, eadem opera, ‘⁸ at the same time ’⁹ (Most. 10393 Capt.
293, 4 59; Mil. Glor. 303, etc.), is always used of two future acts which
are to be performed at the same time, and usually with fut. or fut. perf.
To be distinguished from una opera . . . qua, “as well . . . as.”

d) quisquis, quisque, and quicumque, all containing a duplication
of the indes. interrog. quis, are not yet fully differentiated in use : so
quoquo modo, Men. 827, “ in every way ”3 unum quidquid, Trin. 881,
for unum quidque3 quidquid, Most. 831, etc., all non-relative, and
so even in Cicero. For plur. of quisquis, quicumque is used. quisque
is used for quisquis or quicumque (as indes. rel.) ε Mil. Glor. 1 56,
quemque in tegulis uideritis alienum3 160, · Capt. 798, quemque
offendero, “whomsoever Ι meet,’' and often3 also in late Latin.
quilubet is in Pl. only partially felt as a compound, but quiuis some·
what more clearly.

e) In early Latin quis, indes. or interrog, had no fem. form (cf.
Greek τίς), and 111 Pl. quae is just coming into use. So quis, quiaquia,
quisquam, quisque, quempiam, etc., all fem„ but no case of fem.
aliquis or ecquis· Fem. quae, indes. or interrog„ is also used, but less
frequently: Mil. Glor. 361, illaec quis est mulier? Merc. 684,
nescio quaest mulier intus. ⁴· ’

20· a) Adverbs are often used in predicate >after esse, which was
originally not a mere copula: Ps. 240, ita er03 677, sic erit, etc., and
so ut, bene, male, palam, frustra„etc. An adj. and an adv. are used
together, with verbs which take, either: Men. 1073, stulte dixi atque
inprudens3 Trin. 268, miseros maleque habeas. Both of these
constructions appear also in later Latin.

b) Double negatives ι neque . . . numquam, Ps. 1363 neque . . .
haud, Bacch. 19, 10373 Pers. 535 ;‘ Epid. 664, etc. 3 non . . .‘nemini,
Mil. Glor. 1411. Probably a colloquialism ; also in Petronius», ApuleiuS,
and Gellius.

c) neo, not connective = neque, but = rie-que, “not in any way,”
“not at all ’' ι necullum, Trin. 2823 nec recte dicere = male dicere,
Most. 240, Ps. 10853 Asin. 155, 471, etc. This usage isfound also in
later Latin, and should not be explained by supplying another member
to the sentence.

TENSES.

21. Most of the peculiarities in the use of the tenses are
colloquia13 some are due to early relationships between
tenses, eg. between fut. indie. and preS. subjun0., perhaps
