quiet in their style, with that high finish which is possible
only'in the later periods of a national literature, and the
view of life which found expression in thern was such as is
natural to a racc in its decline, a philosophy of quietism, of
smiling acquiescence in the inevitable. But the Romans at
the end of the war with Hannibal stood at the very begin-
ning of their great destiny‚ of which they were just becoming
conscious. The philosophy of life to which the Athenians
of Alexander's time had come was as unintelligible to thern

to be used in literature; it was in the period of exuberance;
Ennius labors with his language as Aeschylus labors with

customS, to money, and to many such details, Plautus has,
done little more than translate Greek words. Yet even in
these matters he was not able to be consistent. His soldiers
