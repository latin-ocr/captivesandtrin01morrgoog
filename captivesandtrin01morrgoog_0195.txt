Epistulasque iam consignabo duaS,
Eumque huc ad adulescentem meditatum probe
Mittam. CA. Eo ego igitur intro ad officium meum:

Tu istuc age.

CHARMIDES
SENEX

Salsspotenti et multipotenti Iouis fratri et Nerei Nep-

tuno

820

Laetus lubens laudes ago et grates gratiasque habeo

et fluctibus salsiS‚

Quos penes mei fuit summa potestas, bonis mss quid

foret et meae uitae,

817. meditatum, well prepared.
So Mil. Glor. 903, of persons pre-
pared to carry out a trick.

819. actum reddam: cf. trans-
actum reddet, Capt. 34 5 n. - nuga-
cissume : not in the most trffling
manner, as the Lex. defines it,
but so as to carry out the trick com-
pletely ; nugae in the comedy fre-
quently passes from its original
meaning, tristes, to the meaning
tricks.

Megaronides goes off to the
forum and Callicles into his house.
The stage is empty for a moment,
but there is no pause in the action.

ΝΙΝΤΗ ScENE. Charmides
comes in from the left side of the
stage, wearing a cloak (chlamys or
paenula) anda broad-brimmed hat
(petasus, Pseud. 7 35).

This short canticum in anapaestic
octonarii is free from the vagne-
ness of thought which character-
izes some of the more elaborate
cantica. It is a good specimen of
the cantica in a single meter, like
Bacch. 385 ff. ; 925 ff„ and ex-
hibits in a rather marked degree

the distinctive features of the half-
lyrical popular verse, the asynde-ta
(spurcificum, inmanem, intole-
randum, uesanum3 frangere,
ruere, scindere), the alliterations
(laetus lubens laudes; grates
gratias; pauperibus parcere;
diuites damnare atque domare,
mendicis modesti, pax propi-
tia), the fulness of expression (82 1 ;
omnia item una mecum, 8343
quasi . . . haud secus, 835).
These lines deserve careful atten-
tion. There is scarcely a character-
istic of the style of Plautus, except
the idioms proper to dialogue‚
which is not illustrated here.

820 f. Neptuno: dat. after the
whole of 821, ago and habeo,
and et fluctibus salsis is added
as a second half-comic object of
thanks.

822. quos penes ε for the order,
cf. Amph. 6533 Hor. Ars. Poet.
72, quem penes. -— mis = meis ,· cf.
dzlc'=deis.—bonis, uitae: dat.
with foret3 cf. Bacch. 360, quid
milzifiet postea ? what will huppen
to me ,θ
