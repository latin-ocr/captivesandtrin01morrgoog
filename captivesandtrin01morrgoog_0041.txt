INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

seruulus callidus (266 ff„ 516 ff„ 534 ff„ 662 ᾗ), and Philo-
crates in a less degree plays the part of the young man
who profits by the trickery. If the original play is vulgarized
in the hands of PlautuS, as it is, and the result falls short
os justisying the high praise that has been given to the Cap-
tives, it still presents a most interesting illustration of the
mingling of different elements 3 and a caresul observation of
the play from this point of view will greatly assist the
reader toward an understanding of the nature of Latin
comedy.

THE TRINUMMUS.

An approximation to the date of the Trinummus has been
made by Ritschl from the mention os the noui aediles (990).
This can mean only the aediles who have just entered upon
their duties. During the lifetime of Plautus the aediles
were inaugurated on the Ides of March 3 this would suggest

April (Introd. 2). These games were not celebrated with
plays before the year 194 B.c. There is, therefore, a rea-
sonable probability that the play belongs to the last decade
os Plautus’ life.

The Greek original is given in the prologue, the Θησαυρός
os Philemon (floruit 330 B.C.).

Of the houses which projected,frorn the back wall of the
stage one was occupied by CallicleS, one by MegaronideS,
and a third, probably, by Philto (276) and his son Lysiteles,
The house occupied by Callicles had belonged to CharmideS,
and his son Lesbonicus had reserved a lodging in the back
part of the house when he sold the property to Callicles
(194). The entrance to this lodging is in some passages-
(1079, 1 174 f.) represented as different from the front door
of Callicles’ house, but in 400 f. Lesbonicus appears through
