ter, it is probable that the pro-
logu'e as we have it contains the
work of three persons, -- PlautuS,
the writer of 8-16, and the writer
of 46-51.

FIRST SCENE. Ergasilus, the
parasite, comes upon the stage

from the right. His speech is ’

addressed directly to the audience,
with no attempt to keep up the
illusion of a soliloquy.

69. Scorto: the dat. is usual,
though not invariable, with nomen
est, facit, etc.; Stich. 1742 Gelasimo
nomen mihi indidit paruo pater,
and a parasite introduces himself,
as here, in Men. 77, iuuentus nomen
fecit Pem‘culo mihi.

70. inuocatuS, uninvited, as

⁴ applied to the parasite; invoked,

in the other sense; so Curc. 356,
the soldier inuocat Planesium, his
mistresS, as he throws the dice.
cf. the puns upon inuitus and in-
uitare, Trin. 273 Rud. 811.

, 71, derisores: not those who

.-

had given the name, but rivals of
Erg„ who derided him out of
fflvvviyfigassr‘ssuffissffi. Ὴέἰὲἒῖεὲιῗθ f⁰¹'

74. planissume: as a term of
strong assent3 also Ps. 365, Ter.
Phorm. 771, and this suggests
planius», 75. ·‘

77. This vs. is found also Pers.
58 (but edere for edimus), where
it is in· place. Here it was written
in as a gIOSS‚ because it applies to
the life of a parasite.

78. res prolatae: in the courts
and in public business (Cic. ad Att.
XIV. 5), and the point of the next
vs. lies in the formality of the
phrase.

80. quasi: not with quom, but
introducing latent, uiuont. The
use of quasi in actual (not imagi-
nary) comparisons is rare except
in early Latin; Asin. 178, quasi
piscis, itidemst amator ,⁹ Trin. 83 5,
ita iam quasi canes ,⁰ Ps. 199, quasi
Dircam . . . deuinxere, item ego te
