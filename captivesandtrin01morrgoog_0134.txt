Philemo scripsit: Plautus uortit barbare,

Vt liceat possidere hanc nomen fabulam.

MEGAROMDES

SEN EX

Amicum castigare ob meritam noxiam
Inmoenest facinus, uerum in aetate utile

Et conducibile.

nam ego amicum hodie meum 25

Concastigabo pro commerita noxia,
Inustns, ni id me inustet ut faciam fides,

19. Philemo: one of the great
poets of the N ew Comedy‚ from
whose Ἐμπορος Plautus took the
Mercator. — barbare = Latine ,-
see Capt. 492 n.; and cf. Asin.
prol. 1 1, Maccus uortit barbare.
In other prologues, Merc. 10, Mil.
Glor. 87, Poen. 54, Latine is used.

20. Trinummus: a rather acci-
dental name from the sum of
money mentioned in 843 f„ as the
Rudens is named from the rope
which plays a somewhat unimpor-
tant part in a single scene. The
other plays are named after a
leading character or have their
titles in adJective form, Aulularia
sc. fabula, from the pot of money
(aula, olla), Cistellaria from the
little box, Mostellaria, the ghost
story, from monstrum. Terence
uses only Greek titles. — hoc: join
with nomen, 21.

22. ualete: the prologues to the
Casina and the Poenulus also close
with ualete, and it appears from
the prologue to the Poen. and to the
Hecyra of Terence that the appeal
for silence was not a mere form.

Fms‘r senus. Megaronides
comes out of his own house, and
as he speaks the verses of this
scene moves slowly toward the
door of Callicles’ house.

24. immoene facinus, a thank-
less task. The form immunis
is used in 350, 3543 cf. moenia,
munire ‚· poena, punire. For the
sense, cf. Merc. 10 5, gratum et
munem and munus, a gift, a favor.
—in aetate : so 462, but usually
with hominum. Cf. Amph. 633,
in uita atque in aetate agunda, in a
passage of reflective tone like this.

25. nam: here, as often in PL,
introduces the reason which leads
the speaker to make the remark,
not the ground upon which he
believes the remark to be true.
So 1055, below.

27. inuitu8‚ ni . . . inuitet z cf.
Capt. 70, inuocatus, where there is
a similar play upon the negative
in· and the preposition. The ni·
clause expresses an exception to
the negative in inuitus, and it is
not necessary to treat the sentence
as elliptical.
