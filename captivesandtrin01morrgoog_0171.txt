Censetur censu ad Acheruntem mortuos

ST. Mirum quin titillo tecum diuitias feras:

49⁵

Vbi mortuos sis, ita sis ut nomen cluet.

PH. Nunc ut scias hic factiones atque opes

Non esse neque nos tuam neglegere gratiam :

Sine dote posco tuam sororem fssio.

Quae res bene uortat. habeon pactam? quid taces? 500
ST. Pro di inmortales, condicionemquoius modi!

PH. Quin fabulare ‘ di bene uortant: spondeo ’ ?

ST. Eheu, ubi usus nss erat dicto ‘ spondeo '

Dicebat: nunc hic, quom opus est, non quit dlcere.
LE. Quom adfinitate uostra me arbitramini 505
Dignum, habeo uobiS, Phssto, magnam gratiam.

494. censu: with censetur, a
mere doubling of the expression.
— ad Acheruntem: a verb of mo-
tion is implied, . . . are rated in
the rating and sent to Acheron.
Plautus uses only Acheruns, -untis,
with the first syllable long.

495 f. mirum quint afrequent
ironical phrase, implying the nega-
tive of the thought expressed in
the quin-clause. Lit., it is a won-
der ἂστυ you do not . . ., i.e., Iam
surprised that you don't . . . This
should be distinguished from mira
sunt m' (861) or mirum est ni
(Capt. 824), which is not ironical
and implies an affirmative opinion.
—ut nomen cluet, as the word
means, i.e., in the full sense of
the word mortuos· The two vss.
are spoken aside, in ironieal eom-
ment upon the speech of Philt0‚
which seems to savor of conde-
scension in saying that rich and
poor are alike after death. ⁴ Of
course they are. You can’t take
your money with you, and you
might as well acknowledge that

when you are dead you are dead in
the full sense of the term.’

497 f. hic . . . non esse: i.e.,
that influence and money do not
count with us (hic).

500. habeon pactam z sc. rem.
Cf. Poen. 1 1 57, pactam rem habeto,
in a betrothal. The agreement
was made binding by the formal
question and answer, spondesne ? ΙΙ
spondeo, or their equivalent.

502. quin: with pres. indic. zd
pers. this gives a distinct imper-
ative force to the question, so that
quin may even be used with the
impv. form. Cf. Introd. 23 b.

503. eheu : as an interjection
need not suffer elision. — erat
dicto: see Introd. 47. For the
construction, see Capt. 164 n. This
refers to the unfortunate sponsio
alluded to in 427, which had eost
Lesbonicus a thousand drachmae.

504. hic, in this case ,· the adv„
as in 497·
