lous,· Ps. 11673 Amph. 571, and
often. Also ludos facere alicui, to
deceive. In both phrases ludos
is always plu., from the public
gameS.

581. qui z abl. sing. neut. of rel.
Tynd. pretends that Arist. is ac-
cusing him of having been too
poor to own a slave at home.

583. See Introd. 33 c. —boniS,
the richer classes, almost as it is
used politically by Cic.

ut perspicio: Introd. 33 a. —
aliquid pugnae edidit, has played
you some trick ‚· cf. Cic. ad Att. Ι.
16. 1, quas ego pugnas . . . edidi!
There is no exact parallel in Pl.,
but cf. pag-nam dare, Ps. 524, etc„

and pugnasti, Epid. 493, of cheat-
mg.

586. quod . . . ait, id. . ., as to
his saying . . ., that does not please

Amph. 479, etc.; when the sub-
junc. is used, it is potential. Cf.
also Introd. 31 a.

588. In these lines Tynd. again
tells Arist„ as plainly as he can
without exciting the suspicion of
Hegio, that he has changed places
with Philoc. in order to allow him
to escape. Failing to make Arist.
understand, he falls back upon his
original plan of exciting him to
fury by ingenious perversioris of
all that he says.
