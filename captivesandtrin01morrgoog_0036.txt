xxxii INTRODUCTION.

forms nibem, scibam, audibam, are regular for aiebam, sciebam. But
synizesis in most nouns, filio, gratiis (later gratis), is rare and is con·
fined to the less regular meters.

39· Final e was into Cicero’s time a lightly sounded letter; it is
frequently omitted in inscriptions, and does not make position when the
following word begins with a consonant, even in the sixth foot of iambic
senarius: saluos sis, estis nunc, perdis me, etc. So also ain for ais-ne,
satin for sutis-ne, etc. For this reason es, est unite freely with a pre·
ceding word ending in e ; sunu’s = mue es, potitust = potitus est,
unicust = unicus est, nactu’s = nactus es, etc. Examples of these
usages may be found in abundance in¹ any play.

40· Either from frequent use or from some weakness in the conso-
nant soundS, ine, iste, inde, unde, nempe have the first syllable shortz
iste has a form ste, though not in Plautus; in ille the double liquid
was weak (cf. olim); inde and iinde may be due to weakness of the
sound of n, as nempe is certainly to be explained by the weakened
pronunciation of m.

41· That syncope occurs in Plautus„ as in later Latin, is plain, ega
discipulina and disciplina, poplo = populo, poclum = poculum, peri-
clum = periculum, but the extent of the usage has not been fixed.
Perhaps iuuentute in three syllables (cf. iunior) uoluptabilie in four
syllableS, cauillationes in five syllables; but all of these may be ex-
plained, and usually are, by the effect of accent, 46, 47, below.

42· A mute and a liquid’never lengthen the preceding vowel iu
Plautusz exprobra, agrurn, patri.

43· Many inflectional endingS, which were shortened under the
influence of the aeeent or for other reasons before the Augustan age,
retain in Plautus invariably or occasionally their original long quantity.
Thus invariably es, indic. and irnpv. from esse, δι’ in verbs (ιιοοόῐ,
Ῑοςιιόῐ), in nouns (cautor, amor), in comparatives (auctior) and in
ecastor. The original length of conjugational endings is occasionally
retained in the third pers. sing. of the perf. (uixit), of the pres. (scit, it),-
of the subjunctive (sit, fuit, uelit, desideret, eto), and sometimes in
other forms (etia, egit). There are a few probable cases of a in the
nom. of the first decl. (cf. gen. in -ῖιῑ) and in the abl. of the third decl.
-ὄ (sermone, morte). Other early quantities differing from the Augus- ,
tan usage are fuit, ffiimus; fieri, fierem at the end of a verse (cf. fio);
