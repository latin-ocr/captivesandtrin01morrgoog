SENES 11

CA. Larem 'corona nostrum decorari uolo:

onr, uenerare ut nobis haec habitatio ⁴0
Bona fausta felix fortunataque euenat —

Teque ut quam primum possim uideam emortuam.

ME. Hic illest senecta aetate qui factust puer,

Qui admisit in se culpam castigabilem.
CA.

Adgrediar hominem.

ΜΕ. Tui beneuolentis, sl ita’s ut ego te uolo:
Sin aliter eS, inimici atque irati tibi.

CA. O amice, salue, Ι atque aequalis,

Sssconn Setun. Callicles
comes out of his house, turning
back to speak to his wife and not
at first seeing Megaronides. The
first lines enable the audience to
understand that he is the master
of the house, and that he has
recently moved in.

40. haec habitatio, our living

here, with something of verbal
force.

41. euenat=euem·at. So adue-
καί Pseud. 10 303 peruenat Rud.
626, and in a few other cases, all
at the end of a verse. They are
old forms of the 3d conj„ as if
from uene're. So in many cases
Plautus had at his command
double formS‚ due to the unregu-
lated character of the early inflec-
tion, from which he could select
according to metrica] convenience.
Cf. siet at the end of a verse.
- The next line is spoken aside.

43ff. senecta aetate: to be
joined with qui factust puer.
The adj. senectus is rare and al-

ut ualeS,

most confined to the combination
with aetas. — uer: because he had
committed a ault which subjected
him to reproof. But the form
of expression is not very happy
and was chosen in order to intro-
duce the contrast between age
and youth, 45 ff. The elaborate
speeches which precede the recog-
nition of one person by another on
the stage belong to the somewhat
awkward machinery by which the
Greek dramatist attempted to
show to the audience the thoughts
of his characters. Similar and
often much more formal recogni-
tion scenes occur all through the
plays3 eg„ Bacch. 534 f.‚ P. estne
hic meus sodalis ? M. estne hic
hostis quem aspicio meus ἲ Ρ. certe
is est. M. is est. — quoia ι equiv-
alent to a gen. quoius and there-
fore its appos., tui beneuolentiS,
is in the gen. — beneuolentis ε
always in Pl either adj. or noun,

never pte. — On ita’s‚ see Introd-
20 a; for es, Introd. 43.
