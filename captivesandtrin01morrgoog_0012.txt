viii INTRODUCTION.

Umbria, and his command of the Latin language indicates
that he must have come to Rome early in his life. There
is no evidence that he was· a slave, nor, on the other hand,
that he had the· active rights of a Roman citizen. He is
thus between Livius Andronicus and Terence, on one side,
and Naevius and Ennius on the other. There is a brief
account of his life in Aulus GelliuS, III. 3. 14., in which it
is *stated that he made money in some employment about
the theatre, that he lost it on a trading expedition, that he
returned to Rome in poverty and earned his living by turn-
ing a handmill, and that while thus engaged he wrote three
plays, This account contains some improbabilitieS, and
though it is given on the authority of Varro, it must rest·
finally on' oral tradition, ¹since the Roman records of Plautus'
time took no account of literature.

³2. ·’ The games for which the plays of Plautus were written
were either regular or occasional. The regular games were
the Ludi Megalenses in April, the Ludi Romani or Magni
in September, and the Ludi Plebeii in November. The
Ludi Apollinares in July were probably not celebrated with
plays >during the lifetime of Plautus, Beside these festivaIS,
plays were performed also at dedication gameS‚ such as
those at the dedication of the temple of the Magna Mater
in- 191, when the Pseudolus was produced, and at funeral
games,. Of the six plays of Terence, three were written for
the Ludi MegalenseS, one for the Ludi Romani, one for the’
funeral games of L. Aemilius PauluS, and one, the fflcyra,
was first presented at the Ludi Megalenses, a second time,
unsuccessfully, at the same funeral games, and a third time
ag the* Ludi Megalenses or th‘e Ludi Romani. The play
was bought b'y the givers of the games on the recommenda-·
tion of a theatre manager, a dominus gregis who had a troupe
of slaves trained in acting. Under his directions the prepa-
rations for presenting the play were made.
