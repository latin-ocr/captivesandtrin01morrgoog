PLAVTI

[11. 1. 22.

Nox datur: ducitur familia tota,
-Vestiplica, unctor, auri custos, flabelliferae, sandali-

gerulae,

CantriceS, cistellatriceS, m'mtii, rem'mtii,

Raptores panis et peni.

Fit ipse, dum illis comis est,

Inops amator.

255b

Haec ego quom cum animo meo reputo,
Vbi qui eget, quarn preti sit parui,

Apage te, amor, non placeS, nss te utor.
Quamquam sslud est dulce, esse et bibere,

Amor amari dat tamen satis quod aegre sit.

260

Fugit forum, fugat suos cognatos,
Fugat {psus se ab suo contutu,
Neque eum sibi amicum uolunt dici.

Mille modis amor ignorandust,
Procul abhibendust atque abstandus ε

ular forms are -uis and -ί, the
latter being the usual one.

2 52 ff. A similar list of wom-
en’s attendants is given in Aul.
500-520. — raptores z not an-
other elass of followers, but in ap-
position to all.—panis et peni
(from penus, penum): not sharply
distinguished in meaning, but used
together for the similarity of sound3
see Introd. 12.

2 57 f. The indireet question
quam . . . sit depends upon re-
puto and its subject is to be sup-
plied from ubi qui eget in which
qui is the indes. pron. The real
leading verb would be something
like I say to myself, but the thing
said, apage te, is put in its place.
The whole sentence is extremely
colloquial in form. -nil te utor:
cf. the more common nil moro'r,

264b

Capt. 16, and the Engl. slang
phrase, J have no use sor you.

259. illud refers to esse et
bibere, treated as a single expres-
sion for all sels-indulgence.

260. amari: with satis—aegre
sit: see Introd. 20 a.

261. That is, the lover, in his
folly, seeks solitude and, by his
follies, drives away his friends.

264. abhibenduS, kept qff, does
not occur in any Latin author and
is put into the text here only
exempli gratia. — abstandust,
must be held ff involves a transi-
tive use of stare. The distinction
between transitive and intransitive
verbs is not sharply observed even
in class. Latin and was probably
a matter of slow growth in the
langauge. Cf. placenda dos est,

1159.
