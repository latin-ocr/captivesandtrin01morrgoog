Plautus were not copied for the reading public during his
lifetime. After his death and especially after the death of
Terence in 159, when no new plays were being written, the
theatre managers began to produce for a second time the
plays of Plautus which they had in their possession. For
such second presentations the plays were cut down in some
soenes and expanded in others, and the prologues were in
some cases (as the Casina) entirely rewritten. F urther, as
Plautus had been the most popular of the Roman writers of
comedy‚ plays not written by him were probably brought out
under his name. ·When, therefore, in the second half of the
second century 13.c., the early Roman literature became the
subject of study and of learned commentary, many interpo-
lations and revisions had already found a place in the text,
and the number of plays actually written by Plautus was in
doubt. One tradition set the number as high as 130, other
traditions fixed it at 100 or at 40. The names of 55 plays
attributed to Plautus by grammarians have come down to
uS. By a comparison of different lists, Varro, the greatest
of. the earlier Roman grammarians, selected 21 plays as
undoubtedly genuine, and his authority was strong enough
to fix the tradition that these plays constituted the works of
Plautus, Whether they were gathered into a single volume
in his time is not certain, but they were certainly so col-
lected by the end of. the first century after Christ, while
other plays existed only singly in scattered copies, and have
not come down to us,

came at the end of the volume, was lost with the last leaves
of the book, and only fragmentS‚ amounting to a little more
than a hundred lineS, are known. The other twenty playS,
all quite certainly genuine and constituting perhaps half the
works of Plautus, have come down to us in some half-dozen
