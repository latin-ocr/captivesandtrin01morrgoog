TRINVMMVS 97

Vt te uidere audireque aegroti sient.

CA. Qui in mentem uenit tibi istaec dicta dicere?
ΜΕ. Quia omnis bonos bonasque adcurare addecet,
Suspicionem et culpam ut ab se segregent.

CA. Non potest utrumque fleri.

CA. Rogas ἓ

ΜΕ. Quapropter ?
80

Ne admittam culpam, ego meo sum promus pectori:
Suspiciost in pectore alieno sita. ’

Nam minc ego si te surrupuisse suspicer

Ioui coronam de capite ex Capitolio

Qui in columine astat summo: si id non feceris 85 ,
Atque {d tamen mihi lubeat suspicarier,

Qui tu {d prohibere me potes ne suspicer?

Sed istuc negoti cupio scire quid siet.

ME. Haben tu amicum aut familiarem quempiam,

76. aegroti: with infin. So
occupatus, dqfessus, neglegens and
a few other verbaIS, which in com-
bination with esse are equivalent
to a verb. This has nothing to do
with the Greek construction illus-
trated in Roby, II. ι 361. Cf. In-
trod. 24 d. .

77. dicta dicere: the etymolog-
ical figure3 cf. Capt. 774 n.— Note
tibi istaec and non potest, 80.

81 f. The general sense is:
‘ Wrong-doing 1 can guard against,
but the suspicion of others that Ι
have done wrong is beyond my
control.’ The first part of this
thought is expressed through the
figure of the promus (promere),
the steward, who has charge of
the family provisions‘ and can pre-

. vent the admission to the store-

room of anything which should
not find a place there. The figure
is carried on in sita.

83 ff. To steal the crown from
the head of the great statue of
Jupiter on the roof of Ehe temple

on the Capitol was a proverbial
phrase for the commission of a
very great and daring crime, as
in Engl. “to steal a penny from
a blind beggar's hat ’' is typical of
a mean and petty theft. So Men.
941, sacram coronam surrupuisse
Ioui, is named in the same list
with patrem occidzsse and matrem
uendidzsse. The scholiast on Hor.
S. Ι. 4. 94 has absurdly misun-
derstood the saying. -— surru-
puisse = surripuisse ; cf. insulto,
aucupatio, percutio, where ἄ of the
stem becomes uin compounds ς cf.
Capt. 292 n. — columine = cul-
mine‚· both forms continued in
use in class. Latin.

86. The repetition of id is em-
phatic.

88. istuc negoti: inthe proper
2d pers. sense of iste, tlzat of
which you spoke in 67 ff.; negoti

.. in the general sense, matter, is

regularly used in Pl. in the gen.
with a neut. sing. pron„ quid, id,
hoc, ete.
