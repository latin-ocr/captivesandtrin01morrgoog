Fidus fuisti: infidum esse iterant. nam apsque foret

te, sat scio in alto

Distraxissent disque tulissent satellites tui me miserum

foede ⁰ '

Bonaque omnia item una mecum passim caeruleos per

campos :—

Ita iarn quasi canes haud secus circumstabatnt nauem

turbines uenti: · 835

Imbres fluctusque atque procellae infensae frangere ·
. malum,

Ruere antemnaS, scindere uela—ni tua pax propitia

foret praesto,

Apage a me sis: dehinc iam certumst otio dare me:

satis partum habeo,

Quibus aerumnis deluctaui‚ filio dum diuitias quaero,
,Sed quis hic est qui in plateam ingreditur 840²
Cum nouo ornatu specieque simul? 840b
Pol quamquam domi cupio, opperiar:

Quam hic rem agat animum aduortam.

832. infidum esse iterant :
concessive to fidus fuisti ; cf.
Introd. 26 and f. —— iterare means
to go over in words what has been
gone over in acts; so Asin. 567,
tua male facta iterari. —absquet
properly a preposition governing
te (see Lex. and Capt. 7 54 n.), and
the order is elsewhere apsqu( te
(me) foret (esset).

833 f. disque tulissent: tmesis
of preposition and verb is rare in
P1.; quicumque is separated in a
few cases. Such tmesiS‚ where two
words are from the same preposi-
tion, is frequent in LucretiuS, eg„
1. 651, disiectis disque supatis.

837. ni pax . . . foret repeats
the idea of apsque foret te, re-
turning at the end of the sentence

to the thought with which it had
begun. This also makes a con-
trast to the next vs.: ‘ You have
saved me this time, but I shall
not risk it again.' For the same
train of thought, see ‚Mos-t. 43¹ ff.

839. quibus aerumnis implies
eis aerumnis with partum habeo.

840 ff. As Megaronides sees the
oddly dressed sycophanta his atten-
tion is attracted and he breaks off
his monologue and speaks the
next vss. in a new measure, ana-
paestic dimeter.

840. simul: added at the end
of the line, though it is connected
in sense with ingreditur.

841. domi: Introd.14b, though
it may perhaps be a locative‚ with
esse vaguely thought of.
