xxviii INTRODUCTION.

INDIRECT QUEs‘noNS.

27· a) These are still largely in the paratactic stage with the indic. ε
Capt. 623, dic mihi, quis illic igitur est3 Capt. 570, dic rnodo, ten
negas Tyndarum esse ; Most. 614, uide, num moratur, and often.

b) With subjunctive, retained from the direct question z Bacch. 74 5,
loquere, quid scribam ς Merc. 386, dic, quid uelis; Capt. 270,
seruosne esse an liber maueliS, memora mihi.

c) With subjunctive of indirect question, almost as in classical
Latin. But no clear line of distinction can be drawn between b and c ε
Poen. 1008, roga, num quid opus sit 3 Cure. 427, inspiciam, quid sit
scripturn3 Truc. 650, interrogo, quid eum uelit.

SUBORDINATE CLAusES.

28· a) Relative (qui) clauses of purpose always have the subjunc. :
Capt. 1003, dantur quicum (abl.) lusitent3 Bacc'lz. 84, dato qui bene
sit; Poen. 773, eum adlegarunt . . . qui diceret, etc. But in many
cases the original jussive force is still plain.

b) Relative clauses of result and characteristic take sometimes
subjunm: Ps. 390, pauci ex multis sunt amici, homini certi qui
sient 3 Most. 77 3, si quid erit, quod illi placeat3 Aul. 203, est quod in
uisam domum, etc. Mainly in negative sentences or >questions implying
a negative, Ps. 631, 797, 973, 1086, ete„ or after an adj. with tam, and
the potential force of the subjunc. is often plain, eg. .· Bacch. 92, quid
est quod metuas? With indic. ε Trin. 91, sunt quos scio amicos
esse; Ps. 170, est quod domi dicere paene oblitus fui3 Ps. 462;
Bacch. 1149 ; Capt. 263, etc. This is found also in classical Latin.

c) &iuml-adversative clauses have more frequently the indic. : Trin.
905, ridicule rogitaS, quocum una cibum capere soleo; Amph. 637,
ego id nunc experior . . . quoi uoluptas parumper datast, etc.
With subjunc.: Most. 188, tu ecastor erraS, quae quidem illum
exspectes3 Mil. Glor. 59, te omnes amant muliereS, neque id
iniuria, qui sis tam pulcer.

d) All other relative clauses have indicative. Many cases show

’ traces of the original relationship to the interrogative-indefinite quia,

esp. in the fact that the rel. clause frequently precedes the main clause,
and there are traces of the passage from interrogative to rel. by means
of correlation, eg. .· Mil. Glor. 140, nam unum conclaue concubinae
quod dedit mileS, . . . in 00 conclaui . . ‚3 Ter. Adelph. 854, et quoi
rei est, ei rei⁴ hunc sumamus diern.
