[111. 3. 71.

ME. onrem quoque ipsam Ι hane rem ,uti celes face.
Nam pol tacere numquam quicquamst quod queat. 801
Quid nunc stas? quin tu hinc amoues et te moues?
Aperi, deprome inde auri ad hanc rem quod sat est:
Continuo operito denuo: sed clanculum,

Sicut praecepi: cunctos exturba aedibus

805

CA. Ita faciam. ME. At enim nimis longo sermone

utimur z

Diem conficimuS, quom iam properatost opus,
Nil est de signo quod uereare: me uide.
Lepidast illa causa, ut commemoraui, dicere

Apud portitores esse inspectas

810

denique

Diei tempus non uides? quid illum putas
Natura illa atque ingenio? iam dudum ebriust.
Quiduis probare poterit: turn, quod maxumist,

Adferre, non petere hic se dicet.
ME. Ego sycophantam iam conduco de foro:

the speaker is about to say. In
about half of the cases the hearer
indicates by a word or two, usually
quid est ἒ as here, that he is listen-
ing. Cf. quid ais ἒ ΙΙ quid uis ἒ ΙΙ

802. quin: for the use in impv.
questions, see Introd. 25 d. It is
hardly possible that the last part
of the vs. ean be correct in text,
as amoues and moues are nearly
synonymouS‚ but no good emenda-
tion has been proposed.

804. operito: Introd. 23 a.

808. me uide: an expression of
·encouragement‚ look to mc, trust
me, used in Rud. 680 ; Merc. 1013;
Ter. A nd. 350, etc.

809. lepida is one of the ad-
jectives used very freely as a word

- of praise in colloquial speech. ——

dicere ε appos. of causa 3 cf. 259.
811· quid illum putas . . . i·

CA. Iam sat est.
815

what do you think about him ? i.e.,
what do you think he is doing?
So ut illam censes? Cure. 593 ut
eam credis ? Bacch. 208, followed
in each case, as here, by a state-
ment of what the person in ques-
tion is doing or saying. There
must be a half—felt ellipsis of some
general verb, agere, facere, dicere,
of which the acc. is the subject.

813. The bearer of the letter is
the subject of poterit and of dicet,
814. He is not definitely named
before 815, because he is not
thought of in a definite way3 the
main thought is that the oung
man will be easily deceivecl'an
the thought of 813 f. might have
been equally well expressed 1n the
passive

815. sycophantam. cf. 765 f.
and n. on 78 7.
