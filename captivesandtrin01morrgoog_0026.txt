, ,ε) ad in the sense of apud: Capt. 699, in libertates-t· ad patrem in
ρωπίας Capt. prol. 49, ut . . . hic ad suom maneat ραι-11111, Asin.82 5,

d) In constructionsof time and place prepositions are sometimes
used and sometimes omitted without affecting the meaning, this varia-
tion is a survival from the adverbial stage.

With the abl. of “time when ’⁹ no prepos. is used if the noun has an
attributive adj„ pron„ or gen. 2 Pers. 264, die uno; Truc. 497, decumo
mense3 Alere. 33, aduorso tempore. But with the noun alone in is
used ι Capt. 836, in ternpore aduenis3 Bacch. 1127, in anno. There
are‘ some exceptions to this usage.

For the “time within which ” there is no fixed usage: Capt. 168,
in his diebus ς Most. 238, his decem diebus; Pers. 37, in hoe triduo.

>Names of towns are put in acc. of place to which, abl. of place from
which, and abl. or loc. of place in which without a preposition, except
Ephesus (Ephesum or in Ephesum, Epheso or ex Epheso, Ephesi or
in Epheso) and in'Epidaurum, in Elatiam, in Sicyonem. · Piraeus and
Seleucia, are always used with prepos. Acheruns is treated as the name
of a town. ι

With names of small islands there is no fixed usage z Cyprum or in
cyprum, Rhodo .or ex Rhodo·

. Names of countries usually have the prepos, but Aegypto, Most.

4403 Ponto, Truc. 5403 Alidem, Capt. 57 3 Alide, Capt. 330³„ Greek
names in -us are used without prepos. in good prose.

19· a) The persona] pronouns in nom. are expressed in some cases
where they are not emphatic, but the limitations of this usage have
never been accurately fixed. Plautus observes certain customs in re-
gard to order of pers. pron. 2 nom. before oblique case (ego tibi, tute
tibi); subject of infin. precedes ,other cases (te aa me ad cenam dic
uenturum, Most. 1 1343 Capt. 243, 249, etc.); acc. precedes other
oblique cases (me sibi, te mih1); dat. precedes‘ abl. or'acc. with prepOS.
(mihi propter te). Emphasis causes some departures from these
usages (Bacch. 162, tibi ego an tu mihi seruos es Ρ). ’

b) Other pronouns= hic usually refers to the speaker, even when
connected with a second pers. prona Trin. 828, hanc tuam gloriam,

“this of which I am speaking'ss ·M0st 753, hasce aedis tuas„ “where
1 now am) So hic homo— - ego, Trin. 1115, etc.; hoc caput, Ps.
723, haee caneS, Tri.n 172. In t'he same way iste usually implies a
reference to the person addressed and ille a reference to a third person.
But this distinctionis not invariabiy observed.
