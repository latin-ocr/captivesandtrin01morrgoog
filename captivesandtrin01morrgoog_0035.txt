37. The prosody of Plautus is in some particulars differ-
ent from the prosody which the student learns from Vergil
and Horace, and the first impression received from his
versification is of carelessness and license. This impres-
sion, however, is incorrect; the departures from recognized
usage are few, but the usageS, the ruleS, of versification in
the time of Plautus were not so artificial as those of the
Augustan age. There are two reasons for this. F irst‚ the
meters of Plautus were imitated from the Greek meters of
the New Comedy‚ which were less strict than the earlier
dramatic meters or the lyric meters which were the models
of Horace. Second, the prosody of a word is a part of its
pronunciation; and the pronunciation os Latin changed
greatly in the century and a half after the death of PlautuS,
and at all periods the pronunciation of the literary Latin
varied considerably from the unregulated utterance of con-
versation. The peculiarities of prosody in Plautus are
therefore not “poetic licenseS,” but are either survivals of
early pronunciation or colloquialismS.
