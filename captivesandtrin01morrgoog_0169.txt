Et quod illi placeat, praeripiam potissumum ε
Neque illi concedam quicquam de uita mea.
Verecundari neminem apud mensam decet :

465. sie, as I am, in contrast
with luscus·

468 ff. These lines allude to the
custom of offering a tenth to Her-
cules in the form of a feast to the
people (cena popularis, 470) in
a temple (aedem, 468). At such
a feast citizens of different soeial
standing might be placed near
each other at the table. —parz
neighbor on the couch, appears to
refer to the Greek custom, accord-
ing to which two persons occupied
one couch, not three, as at Roman
dinners.—The force of si, 468,
extends to adposita . . . sit, and
it is not necessary that si should
be repeated or that a connective
word should be used. Cf. Pseud.
863, where a condition, preceded
and followed by si clauses, is ex-
pressed without si. — The thought
of the passage is this: ‘ Suppose
you went to a public feast, where
citizens meet on equal terms, and

found yourself at the table with a

richer man ; if his clients brought “

abundance of food to the table,
enough for both of you, would
you allow his wealth or position to
overawe you so that you should
take no food for yourself ?’

474. nisi si ε found occasionally
also in class. Latin. It is collo-
quial in origin, but the force of si
is not wholly lost, since nisi ex-
presses an exception rather than
a condition. The clause usually
contains quis or a compound;
Amph. 8253 Cure. 52; Capt. 5303
but not always, Epid. 22.

477. de uita mea, os what
touches my laejfe, i.e., food and drink.

478 f. Bri-x quotes from Scaliger
theformula said to have been
used in introducing important
matters for debate in the Senate ;
nulla uerecundia nos debetdem ouere
a sententia dicenda, ubi de rebus
diuinis et humanis agitur..
