’9. Alide=Elide. Many Doric
forms came into the Latin lan-
guage from the Greeks of southern
Italy, and Plautus frequently uses
them instead of the Attic forms

which he had before him in the ,

original Greek play.

10. The text is metricaIly in-
coroect, but the sense is clear.
iam adds urgency to the question,
and is several times used with
tenes, tenetis, do you get this ἒ
huiusce is Philocrates.

11. This verse also is incorrect

· in meter, and is not satisfactory

in sense. The speaker apparently
pretends that some one in the
rear answers the question iam hoc
tenetis? in the negative. He calls
to him to come forward, and as of
course no one responds to the in-
vitation, the speaker pretends that

· it is because there is no vacant

space in from, and suggests that
the grumbler had better walk out.
ambulare is properly to take a
walk, but here ironically used for
' walking out of the theatre.

13. mendicarier, as explained
by 14, must mean ‘⁴ to reduce him-
self to beggary by ruining his
voice.” Cf. Poen. 540, tua causa
nemo nostrorumst suos rapturus
ramices ; Merc. 138, 151, etc. This
old infin. termination is largely

used in P1., almost always at the
end of a senarius or trochaic sep-
tenarius, since the long syllables
drier, etc., make a good close. In
the 3d conj„ only verbs with long
stem-vowel, like dicier, dacier, take
this ending.

14. ne erres is halfway be-
tween a prohibition and a paren·
thetical clause of purpose. Such
clauses are frequent in Pl. with
a verb of thinking wrongly. Cf.
the, English slang and don’t you
forget it.

15 f. The objector is supposed
to have gone out, and the rest of
the audience are flatteringly ad·
dressed as people of property
(opibus censi), in contrast to the
citizens who had no property
(capite censi), in order to introduce

the joke of 16.— relicuom (in-

four syllables, as always in PL),
the rest of the prologue, spoken of
as if it were a sum of money owed
to the audience, hence alieno.
— nil moror, I do not keep, delay,
and so I do not care for, either
with a direct object, istos mores,
Trin. 297, or with an infin. With
{sffifflffassfjssffsslnisse 32¹²}ssssssss
and of discharging one who was
on trial.
17. dixeram: Introd. 21 d.
