PLAVTI

[m. 2. 41.

Pectus opscurasse: atque ipse amoris teneo omnis uias,
itast amor ballista ut iacitur: nss sic celerest neque

uolat ε

Atque is mores hominum moros et morosos efficit.
Minus placet magis quod suadetur: quod dissuadetur

placet.

670

Quom inopiast, cupias: quando eius copiast, tum non

uelis.

(ille qui aspellit, is compellit: ssle qui consuadet, uetat.)
insanum malumst hospitio deuorti ad Cupidinem.
Sed te moneo hoc etiarn atque etiam ut reputes quid

facere expetas,

51 istuc ut conare facis, † indicium tuom incendes

genus:

668. ballista: the missile, not
the machine; Capt. 796 n.

669. moros (μωρὸς) = taken over
from the Greek by PlautuS‚ and is
used especially with mos and mo-
lestus for the alliteration.

670. A combination of two

slightly differing thoughts into -

one expression3 non placet quod
(tibi) suadetur and eo minus placet
quo mag-125 suadetur.

671. cupias», uelis: the indefi-
nite 2d pers.

673. insanum: an adv. with
malum ς so insanum magnum,
Bacch. 761 ; insanum bonam, Most.
908; insanum bene, Mil. Glor. 24.
It is a slang use of the word.—
deuorti: the regular word for
going to an inn or to lodge with a
friend, e.g.‚ Pseud. 6 583 Mil. Glor.
1 4, 741·

3675—678. The thought of these
lines is confused and the confu-
sion is increased by errors and
ambiguities in the MSS.

The general idea is, ‘ If you per-
sist in depriving yourself of that

675

property you will do an injury to
your whole family, and when you
try to recover yourself you will
only increase -the injury to the
utter ruin of your posterity.'

Put into figurative language, this
becomes„ ‘ If you do this you will
be setting fire to your family
house ; then you will try to put out -'
the fire with water, and being a
lover and therefore a fool (as I
have shown above), you will ut-
terly extinguish the fire and leave
not a spark on the family hearth.’
The figure has run away with the
thought. Fire, which in 675, 676
is the destroying force, becomes in
678 (and in the reply of Lesboni-
cuS‚ 679) the spark of life (cf. 492)
from which a new family life might
spring up. This confusion is in-
dependent of the uncertainties of
the text.

675. istuc: the transfer of the
ager to Lysiteles as dowry.—in-
dicium: entirely corrupt. The
conjecture ordinarily adopted for
indicium tuom is incendio.
