Argentum amanti homini adulescenti, animi impoti,
Qui exaedificaret suam incohatam ignauiam?

CA. Non ego illi argentum redderem?

redderes

ME. Non

Neque de sslo quicquam neque emeres neque uenderes

serit is indefinite, the person to
whom M. might be tutor, but of
course with special reference to
Lesbonicus.

144. ut: repeated from 141 be-
cause of the long interruption. So

prius quam . . . prius, Pseud. 524.

145. sumes ubi ε as if the
secret were a deposit of money,
placed in a certain spot. The
figure is rather common in Pl.—-
