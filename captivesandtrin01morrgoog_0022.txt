sound remained in use as ornaments of style. Alliteration
is frequent (Trin. 26, 28, 33, 34, 35, 38, etc.), and is often
extended to two or three letterS, especially where verbs com-
pounded with the same preposition are used together.
Words with the same termination are of course common,
but Plautus uses them in such ways as to make it plain that
the rhyme is intentional, for example, in the first half of the
trochaic septenarius, qua cibatus conmeatus3 et datores et
factores3 per medicinas, per tonstrinas; inuenietur, ex-
quiretur. The repetition of words of the same stem in dif-
ferent construction (suspicio . . . suspicarier, oculos in
oculi& amane amantem, ete.) is of the same nature, and
this is often carried further into the figura etymologica, where
words of the same stem are brought into close grammatical
relation. Such combinations as misere miser, madide
madeo, dicta dicere, laetitia laetus, memor meminit were
agreeable to the Roman ear, though they lack point to uS.
Puns by a play upon different senses of the same word or
by bringing together two different words of similar sound
are found in all the plays, and attentionis called to them in
the notes. In all these uses of, similar sounds to highten
the effect of the verse or to add to the liveliness of a pas-
sage, Plautus is not inventing ornaments of style, but is
making free use of a general peculiarity of colloquial speech.
It is most effective in the cantica, or in passages like Capt.
903 ff., Trin. 2 52 ff., 820 ff„ but the Romans used it even
in solemn formulas (faustum felixque) and in the most
serious passages (hostis pro hospite, Livy, 1. 58. 8, in
Lucretia’s words to her husband), where it seems to us
entirely inappropriate.

The syntax· of Plautus is peculiar. On the one hand, col-
loquial language deviates easily from strict rules and forms
many idioms which take on a meaning different from that
